# BURNBOOK — Game Pitch Document

**The Sims meets Nightcrawler — inside a mid-2000s reality TV production suite**

*You're the showrunner. Cast AI personalities with real desires, real breaking points, and real secrets. Manufacture drama for ratings — but the cast is alive, unpredictable, and keeping a burn book of their own.*

---

## THE HOOK

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Elevator Pitch

**Cast reality TV shows with AI-driven personalities who form real alliances, fall in actual love, and have genuine breakdowns — then control the edit to decide what America sees, in a simulation that looks and feels like a 2005 television production suite.**

### Scroll-Stop Line

> "I made her cry on camera for a 2.3 ratings bump. She never forgave me. The audience never forgot."

### The "Oh, That's Cool" Moment

The player opens a manila dossier — the burn book — on a cast member named Jade. Page one: childhood pageant queen, estranged mother, crippling need for approval. Page two: psychological profile, stress threshold, likely triggers. The player drags Jade into a dinner scene with Marcus, who she doesn't know just got a secret phone call from his ex. The player also seats Tanya — Jade's only ally — at the far end of the table, out of reach. Cameras roll. The AI plays it out: Marcus is distant, Jade spirals, Tanya can't intervene. Jade breaks. Tears. Real ones. The player cuts to the editing bay, splices in a confessional from two days ago where Jade said "I'm fine, I'm totally fine," and drops the segment into the episode timeline. Nielsen projections tick upward. A producer's note pops up: "Legal flagged Jade's contract clause. If she walks, we lose the season."

**That's the GIF. That's the five-second scroll-stop. You just watched someone become the villain of their own story — and the player held the scissors.**

## THE CORE

*[REED speaks]*

### Core Fantasy

The player wants to feel like the most powerful person in television — the one behind the curtain who decides what's real. Not the star. Not the audience. The architect. The person who knows everyone's secrets, controls every situation, and shapes the truth through the edit. The fantasy is omniscience corrupted by incentive: you know everything about these people, and you're rewarded for exploiting it.

What's the loop? Let me break it down.

### Core Loop

**30-second loop:** Read a cast member's emotional state, cross-reference it with your burn book intel, and make a placement decision. Who sits next to whom at dinner? Who gets the date card? Who shares a room? Every micro-decision is a bet on human chemistry — you're placing volatile elements next to each other and hoping for a reaction, not an explosion.

**5-minute loop (The Scene Cycle):** Set up a scene. Choose location, cast members, props, and hidden catalysts (a planted letter, a overheard phone call, a surprise guest). Watch the AI play it out in real-time. The scene generates raw footage — multiple camera angles, confessionals triggered by emotional spikes, unplanned moments. Evaluate the footage for drama value, narrative coherence, and legal risk.

**30-minute loop (The Episode Cycle):** Take all your raw footage from multiple scenes and enter the editing bay. Select which moments air, which get cut, which get recontextualized through juxtaposition. Add confessional voice-overs, music cues, and producer narration. Assemble a broadcast episode. Submit to the network. Receive Nielsen ratings, audience sentiment analysis, advertiser reactions, and critical reviews. Check for fallout: cast member meltdowns, alliance shifts, potential lawsuits, tabloid leaks.

**Meta loop (The Season Arc):** Manage the season trajectory. Eliminate cast members (or let them self-destruct). Introduce twists, new cast, format changes. Navigate network pressure for specific storylines. Build toward a finale that maximizes ratings while keeping the show legally and ethically intact enough to get renewed. Between seasons: casting calls, format pitches, reputation management.

### Core Mechanics

1. **The Burn Book (Intelligence System)** — Your secret dossier on every cast member. Contains psychological profiles, personal histories, insecurities, desires, relationship maps, stress levels, and predicted breaking points. Information is gathered through confessionals, producer conversations, background checks, and surveillance. The burn book is your primary strategic tool — but intel degrades. People change under pressure. Your profile from week one may be dangerously wrong by week six.

2. **The Situation Engine (Drama Manufacturing)** — A placement and catalyst system where you engineer volatile social situations. Assign cast members to locations, pair them for challenges, control information flow (who knows what, who doesn't). Drop catalysts — a bottle of champagne when tensions are high, a letter from home when someone's wavering, a surprise elimination when alliances have solidified. The AI resolves these situations with emergent behavior. You can set the table, but you can't script the meal.

3. **The Edit Bay (Narrative Control)** — A timeline-based editing interface where you assemble broadcast episodes from raw footage. Every scene generates multiple camera angles and moments. You choose what airs. You control juxtaposition — cutting from a heartfelt confession to a contradictory action. You add music cues that reframe neutral moments as sinister or romantic. You write chyrons. The edit is where you manufacture villains and heroes from people who are neither. This is where the player's authorial power is most visible and most morally compromised.

4. **The Ratings Engine (Feedback System)** — Simulated audience response to your broadcast episodes. Nielsen ratings, social media buzz (rendered as a scrolling feed of viewer reactions), advertiser confidence, critical reviews, and network satisfaction. Different audience segments want different things: drama addicts want conflict, romantics want love stories, justice seekers want fairness, chaos agents want meltdowns. You can't please everyone. Your ratings determine budget, cast quality, and creative freedom for future seasons.

5. **The Fallout System (Consequences)** — Cast members are not content. They're AI agents with memory, dignity thresholds, and legal representation. Push too hard and they break — genuine psychological damage that manifests as erratic behavior, withdrawal, substance issues, or walking off set. Their lawyers send cease-and-desist letters. Tabloids run stories. Former cast members go on talk shows. Scandals from season two resurface in season five. The fallout system is the long tail of your choices, the weight that keeps drama manufacturing from being a frictionless optimization game.

### What Mastery Looks Like

A beginner creates obvious drama — puts the two loudest people together and waits for the screaming match. They over-edit, making every episode feel manipulative. Ratings spike and crash. Cast members burn out fast. The show gets cancelled after two seasons.

An expert reads the burn book like a chess board. They know that the deepest drama isn't the screaming match — it's the quiet betrayal. They engineer slow-burn arcs across episodes: a friendship that curdles, a romance that's doomed, a villain origin story that the audience doesn't see coming until episode seven. They edit with restraint — sometimes the most powerful cut is the one you don't make. They manage cast sustainability, knowing that a cast member at 60% stress produces better television than one at 95%. They play the meta-game: building a reputation that attracts better cast, negotiating with the network from a position of strength, creating a signature style that audiences associate with their showrunner brand.

The verb separation is critical: beginners REACT to drama. Experts CULTIVATE it.

### Unique Mechanic: The Edit Bay

Other management sims let you build things. BURNBOOK lets you *rewrite what happened*. The Edit Bay is the mechanic no other game has — a system where you take real (simulated) events and reshape them into narrative through editorial choices. The raw footage is the truth. The broadcast is your version. The gap between them is where the game lives. Every other game about media is about making content. This game is about making meaning — and the violence of that act.

### Depth Stress-Test

- **Hour 1:** Learning the interface. Casting your first show. Placing people in rooms and watching what happens. The thrill of the first unscripted fight. Simple edits. First ratings report.
- **Hour 20:** Managing three simultaneous storylines across a 12-person cast. Navigating a love triangle that emerged organically. Dealing with a cast member who's figured out they're being manipulated and is playing the system back. A network executive demanding more romance, less conflict. Your burn book is dense with crossed-out assumptions.
- **Hour 100:** You're on season six. Former cast members appear on other shows referencing yours. Your showrunner reputation precedes you — some cast members sign on because of you, others refuse. You've developed a signature editing style the simulated critics have named. You have a rival showrunner (AI) whose show airs in the same timeslot. The industry remembers everything you've done. Is this a system or a one-off? It's a system. It's deep. And it still holds.

## THE HEART

*[NOVA speaks]*

### Theme

**BURNBOOK is about the distance between a person and their story — and who profits from that distance.**

Every mechanic tells a story here, and the story is about authorship. Who owns a person's narrative? The person who lives it, or the person who edits it? Reality television is the most honest lie ever told: real people, real emotions, manufactured context. The player sits in the exact center of that contradiction, wielding the scissors.

Beneath the production mechanics, this is a game about empathy under capitalism. You will come to know these AI cast members — their childhoods, their fears, the lies they tell themselves, the things they want so badly it makes them stupid. And then you will use that knowledge to make content. The game never tells you this is wrong. It rewards you for it. The question it asks instead is quieter, and worse: *at what point did you stop seeing them as people?*

### The World

It is 2005, and reality television is eating American culture alive. The world of BURNBOOK is the backstage of that phenomenon — a universe of production offices with fluorescent lighting and stained ceiling tiles, editing suites that smell like cold coffee and desperation, casting rooms where human beings audition to be characters. The aesthetic is institutional: call sheets on clipboards, Post-it notes on monitors, Nielsen printouts with coffee rings, VHS tapes labeled in Sharpie, production binders with color-coded tabs.

The wound of this world is **the commodification of vulnerability**. Everyone who enters this machine — cast, crew, producer — trades something real for something that performs realness. The cast trades their privacy. The crew trades their empathy. The player trades their conscience. And the audience? The audience trades nothing. They just watch. That asymmetry is the scar that runs through every scene.

Where does the world crack? In the confessionals. Those tiny rooms with a single camera where cast members speak to no one and everyone at once. The confessional is the only space in the game where a character might say something true — and it's also the space most ruthlessly strip-mined for broadcast content.

### The Player's Emotional Arc

**Season One (Beginning):** Power and play. The production suite is a toybox. Cast members are dolls you can arrange. Drama is fun. Ratings are a score. There's a gleeful puppetmaster energy — the game encourages it. You feel clever. You feel in control.

**Mid-run (The Turn):** A cast member does something that wasn't in your plan. They say something in a confessional that lands differently — not as content, but as testimony. You realize the burn book entry you wrote on them was reductive. They're more complicated than your profile. You start to feel the weight of the edit — the version you aired last episode made someone a villain, and now the other cast members are treating them accordingly. Your edit became their reality. What does the player FEEL here? Complicity.

**Late Seasons (The Reckoning):** You've seen the machine from the inside. Former cast members carry scars from your decisions. Some thrived — became celebrities, found love, built careers on the platform you gave them. Others didn't. The game doesn't moralize. It just shows you the ledger. The emotional destination isn't guilt. It's *recognition* — the uncomfortable awareness that the distance between "producing good television" and "exploiting human vulnerability" isn't a line. It's a spectrum. And you've been on it the whole time.

### Story Hook

**"The most-watched moment in television history was a woman's worst night — and you're the one who made sure the cameras were rolling."**

The narrative thread across seasons: your first cast member, the one who made your career. The moment you built your show around. As seasons pass, their story continues — off-camera, in tabloids, in callbacks from new cast members who reference them. What happened to them after your show made them famous? The answer is the ghost that haunts your production suite. Not because the game forces you to confront it, but because the systems keep generating echoes. Every mechanic tells a story, and this story is about what happens to people after the cameras stop rolling and nobody's watching.

### Characters (AI-Generated Archetypes)

Every cast member is procedurally assembled from trait systems, but they crystallize into recognizable archetypes that the player learns to read — and misread:

- **The Sweetheart:** Genuinely kind, audience favorite. Their wound: they need to be liked so desperately that they'll tolerate anything. The temptation: weaponize their likability. The risk: when they finally break, it's catastrophic — and the audience blames you.
- **The Villain:** Aggressive, confrontational, great television. Their lie: they think being feared is the same as being respected. What the burn book doesn't tell you: they volunteered for this role because invisibility is worse than infamy.
- **The Strategist:** Playing the game within the game. They know they're on a show. They're performing. The tension: are they manipulating you, or are you manipulating them? When two puppet masters pull the same strings, who's the puppet?
- **The Romantic:** Here for love, or at least the performance of love. Their need: to be chosen. Their wound: they've never been anyone's first choice. The drama potential is enormous, but real feelings have real consequences when the show ends.
- **The Wildcard:** Unstable, unpredictable, ratings gold. They are the person who says things on camera that make the network's lawyers flinch. Their breaking point is closer than you think, and when they shatter, the shrapnel hits everyone.
- **The Ghost:** The quiet one. The editors don't know what to do with them. But they're watching everything, and in episode eight, they'll say four sentences in a confessional that reframe the entire season.

## THE MARKET

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Target Audience

**Primary:** Adults 24-40 who grew up watching the golden age of reality TV and now consume it with critical, guilty-pleasure self-awareness. They watch The Bachelor ironically (and sincerely). They listen to reality TV podcasts. They've read "Reality Bites Back." They've thought about what it would be like to be the one pulling the strings. They're on r/BravoRealHousewives, r/thebachelor, r/survivor, and reality TV Twitter. This audience is MASSIVE and almost completely unserved by games.

**Secondary:** Management sim and tycoon enthusiasts (Two Point Hospital, Game Dev Tycoon, Megaquarium players) looking for a new theme with AI-driven depth. They want systems to optimize, but they'll stay for the emergent stories.

**Tertiary:** Players who love AI-driven social simulation (The Sims, Dwarf Fortress, RimWorld). The idea of AI characters with genuine internal states, unpredictable behavior, and persistent memory is catnip for this audience.

**The gap:** There is no good reality TV simulation game. Full stop. There are mobile cash-grabs with licensed branding and zero depth. There's nothing on Steam that treats this subject with mechanical sophistication and narrative intelligence. The audience exists. The appetite exists. The game doesn't — yet.

### Comparable Games

1. **"If The Sims met Nightcrawler (2014)"** — AI-driven human simulation where your incentive is to capture the worst moments of people's lives and broadcast them for profit. Social systems with moral weight.

2. **"If Game Dev Tycoon met UnReal (the TV show)"** — A behind-the-scenes management sim about an entertainment industry that runs on manufactured emotion. Strategic depth masked as creative work.

3. **"If Papers, Please met The Truman Show"** — Interface-as-gameplay, moral compromise baked into the core loop, a system that makes you complicit in something you slowly realize is monstrous. The bureaucracy of spectacle.

4. **"If RimWorld met Big Brother"** — Emergent AI storytelling in a confined social space, where you control the environment but not the people, and the gap between plan and outcome is where the stories live.

5. **"If Hypnospace Outlaw met America's Next Top Model"** — Period-authentic interface wrapping a simulation with genuine emotional stakes. Nostalgia as mechanic, exploitation as theme.

### Unique Selling Proposition

**No game has ever put you in the showrunner's chair with AI cast members who actually behave like real people.** The mobile reality TV games are shallow dress-up simulators. The tycoon games treat media as a spreadsheet. BURNBOOK is the first game that makes the full pipeline playable — casting, situation design, filming, editing, broadcast, and consequence — with AI agents whose unpredictable behavior is both your greatest tool and your greatest threat. Show the GAME, not the features: show a player engineering a dinner scene, cutting to the edit bay, assembling a narrative from chaos, and watching the ratings come in while a cast member's stress meter climbs. That's the hook in five seconds.

### Platform Fit

**PC (Steam)** — Primary. The editing bay interface demands mouse precision. The production suite aesthetic is native to PC. The target audience lives on Steam and plays management sims there. How does this look on a Steam capsule? A dimly lit editing bay, multiple monitors showing different camera angles of a crying cast member, a hand reaching for the "AIR" button. Tags: Simulation, Management, Story Rich, Choices Matter, Dark Comedy, Singleplayer, Strategy.

**Steam Deck** — Strong secondary. Session-based gameplay (episode cycles) fits portable play. The management interface translates to trackpad.

**Console** — Post-launch consideration. The editing timeline would need controller-friendly redesign, but the audience crossover with reality TV viewers on console is significant.

## THE SCOPE

### Feature Pillars (Non-Negotiable)

1. **The Burn Book (Intelligence System)** — Dossier-based psychological profiling for every cast member. Dynamically updated with new intel from confessionals, producer conversations, and observed behavior. Information accuracy degrades over time as characters evolve under pressure. The strategic foundation of every decision in the game.

2. **AI Cast Ensemble (Social Simulation)** — Persistent AI agents with procedurally generated backstories, personality traits (Big Five + custom axes for televisuality, self-awareness, and stress tolerance), relationship systems, emotional states, memory, and genuine unpredictability. They form alliances without prompting. They fall in love without scripting. They break without warning. Every playthrough generates a unique cast with unique dynamics.

3. **The Situation Engine (Drama Manufacturing)** — A systemic framework for engineering social confrontation. Location placement, information asymmetry, catalyst injection, and environmental manipulation. The player sets conditions; the AI resolves outcomes. The gap between intention and result is the core tension of every scene.

4. **The Edit Bay (Narrative Assembly)** — A timeline-based editing interface for assembling broadcast episodes from raw scene footage. Camera angle selection, moment sequencing, confessional insertion, music cue placement, chyron writing, and juxtaposition editing. The system where the player exercises authorial control over the narrative — transforming events into story, people into characters.

5. **The Ratings and Fallout Loop (Consequence Engine)** — Simulated broadcast with audience response (Nielsen ratings, social media sentiment, advertiser reactions, network notes) and cast fallout (stress events, legal threats, tabloid coverage, post-show trajectories). Every episode has mechanical consequences and narrative echoes. Actions compound across seasons.

### Stretch Goals (Ordered by Impact)

1. **Rival Showrunner System** — A competing AI showrunner producing a rival show in the same timeslot. Their casting choices, format innovations, and ratings performance create a competitive meta-layer. Steal their rejected cast members. Counter-program their episode themes.

2. **The Reunion Special** — End-of-season event where eliminated cast members return, watch clips, and react. A live confrontation engine where old wounds reopen and the player's editorial choices are challenged on-camera. Functionally a boss fight disguised as a talk show.

3. **Format Laboratory** — Design your own show formats beyond the initial templates. Combine elements: dating + competition, survival + talent show, social experiment + game show. Pitch formats to the network with projected demographics and risk profiles.

4. **The Writers' Room** — Hire AI producers with their own ethical boundaries and specializations. A narrative producer who builds love stories. A chaos producer who engineers meltdowns. A strategist who handles the network. Staff management as a secondary system.

5. **Cultural Moment System** — Certain episodes, if they hit the right combination of drama, authenticity, and timing, become "cultural moments" — events that transcend the show and enter the simulated public consciousness. Water-cooler moments. Meme-worthy scenes. These generate exponential audience growth but also exponential scrutiny.

### Cut List (NOT in v1)

- **Playable cast member mode** — You are the producer, not a contestant. Playing as a cast member is a different game entirely. Don't dilute the core fantasy.
- **Real licensed show formats** — Use original formats inspired by real shows. "The Isle" (Survivor), "Heartshot" (The Bachelor), "House of Strangers" (The Real World), "Runway War" (America's Next Top Model). Parody is safer, more flexible, and legally clean.
- **Multiplayer** — The showrunner fantasy is solitary. Multiplayer would require a fundamentally different design.
- **3D environments** — The game is the production suite. Scenes play out as multi-camera feeds on monitors within the editing bay, not as explorable 3D spaces. The mediated view IS the point.
- **Mobile port** — The edit bay timeline and burn book interface demand precision. Mobile would require a ground-up redesign that compromises the core experience.
- **Voice acting for cast members** — Text-based confessionals and dialogue are cheaper, more varied, and allow the AI generation system to produce truly emergent content without the bottleneck of voice recording.

## Key Art / Mood Direction

**Primary image:** A dimly lit editing suite, late at night. Three monitors glow in the darkness — one shows a wide shot of a dinner table where two cast members are mid-argument, one shows a close-up of a woman's face caught between anger and tears, one shows a confessional booth with an empty chair. The desk is cluttered with production detritus: a dog-eared call sheet, a coffee-stained Nielsen printout reading "2.7 SHARE," a manila folder stamped CONFIDENTIAL with a cast member's headshot paper-clipped to the front. A hand hovers over a keyboard. Red "RECORDING" lights glow in the background. It's 3 AM in a production office, and tomorrow fifty million people will see what you decide tonight.

**Color palette:**
- **#1a1a2e** — Deep production-suite navy. The darkness behind the monitors.
- **#e94560** — Recording-light red. Danger. The moment you press AIR.
- **#f5c518** — Nielsen gold. Ratings. The number that justifies everything.
- **#0f3460** — Monitor blue. The cold light of surveillance footage.
- **#16213e** — Editing timeline dark. Where the sausage gets made.
- **#c4c4c4** — Fluorescent office grey. Institutional. The production office at 2 PM.
- **#ff6b6b** — Stress indicator coral. A cast member approaching their breaking point.

**Typography:** The logo should look like it was designed by a mid-2000s cable network graphics department. Bold, condensed, slightly italicized — the kind of font you'd see on a VH1 promo bumper or an E! True Hollywood Story title card. Think Impact or Compacta, tight tracking, maybe a metallic gradient that reads as cheap glamour. The word "BURN" in hot red, "BOOK" in cold white.

**UI Mood:** The entire interface is a 2005-era television production suite. Avid editing software with its grey panels and colored timeline tracks. Security-camera-style multi-view monitors. Cast management screens that look like crew call sheets. Nielsen reports rendered as printouts with dot-matrix typography. The burn book itself is a physical-feeling document — manila folder texture, typed notes with handwritten annotations, paper-clipped photos, highlighted text, Post-it notes. Everything feels like it was touched by human hands in a windowless office.

**Audio Mood:** The ambient sound of a production office — humming fluorescent lights, distant phones ringing, the click-whir of tape decks. Scene footage plays with the specific tinny quality of production monitors. Music stingers when ratings come in — brassy, dramatic, the exact sound of a 2005 reality show bumper going to commercial. The burn book pages rustle. Keyboards clack. The editing suite hums with the low-frequency presence of machinery processing human lives into entertainment.

**Tone:** Darkly funny. Not satirical — sincere enough to be uncomfortable. The game loves reality television the way a surgeon loves the human body: with intimate knowledge, professional detachment, and an awareness that what they're doing would horrify most people if they watched closely. It should feel like a Michael Mann film set in a VH1 office.

## Open Questions & Next Steps

### Design Questions [REED]

- How much real-time versus abstracted time? Do scenes play out in real-time like The Sims, or compressed like a Football Manager match engine? The answer determines session length and pacing. Current instinct: compressed with the ability to "let it play" on key scenes.
- How granular is the edit bay? Full timeline editing (Premiere Pro simulation) or simplified card-based assembly (Reigns-style choice sequencing)? The edit bay needs to feel powerful without feeling like actual video editing software. Where's the depth without the tedium?
- What's the economic model between seasons? Is there a budget system? Does the player manage finances, or is money abstracted into "production value" as a reputation metric?
- How does the burn book intel system handle accuracy? Should the player always trust their burn book, or should profiles be unreliable — requiring the player to verify intel through gameplay? Unreliable profiles create richer gameplay but risk frustrating the player. The AI cast members grow and change — the burn book should reflect that tension between fixed profiles and living people.

### Narrative Questions [NOVA]

- How do we handle the ethics without preaching? The game should make the player feel the weight of their choices without ever saying "you're a bad person." The mechanics should create moral texture, not moral lectures. The confessional is the key space — when a cast member looks at the camera and says something real, the player should feel the gap between "this is good content" and "this is a human being."
- What's the long arc? Does the showrunner have a personal story, or are they a blank slate? Current instinct: blank slate with accumulated reputation that functions as characterization. You become the showrunner your choices define. Who is this character when no one's watching?
- How do we handle cast members post-elimination? Their stories should continue off-screen, surfacing through tabloid headlines, social media posts, and callbacks from remaining cast. The haunting should be systemic, not scripted.

### Marketing Questions [HYPE]

- The announce trailer should be a fake "behind the scenes" documentary. Handheld camera. Production office footage. A producer saying "we can make her the villain or the victim — it depends on the edit." Then cut to the game interface. The internet will lose its mind.
- The Steam Next Fest demo should be a single episode of a single show — casting, one dinner scene, one edit, one ratings report. That's enough to demonstrate the loop and generate wishlists.
- Reality TV podcasts are the media channel. Not traditional gaming press first — reality TV press. Get the Bachelor recappers and Survivor strategists talking about this game. They will understand it instantly and their audiences are enormous. Start building the audience NOW.
- What's the GIF? A split-screen: left side shows the raw footage of a tender moment between two cast members. Right side shows the same moment, re-edited with sinister music and a chyron that reads "BUT IS IT REAL?" Same footage. Different story. That's the game in five seconds.

### Next Steps

1. Prototype the Situation Engine with four AI cast members in a single scene. Prove that emergent drama works.
2. Prototype the Edit Bay with pre-generated footage. Prove that editing feels like authorship, not busywork.
3. Build the burn book UI. The tactile feel of the dossier is a massive hook on its own.
4. Paper-design the Ratings Engine — what variables drive audience response, and how do they interact?
5. Write the first show format: "House of Strangers" (The Real World-style format, simplest cast dynamics, best for proving the core loop).
6. Mood art: the editing suite at 3 AM. If that image doesn't make people feel something, the game won't either.
7. Steam page goes live the moment the edit-bay GIF exists. This game was BUILT for social media.

*BURNBOOK is the game about the most dangerous room in television — the editing suite where real people become characters, real pain becomes content, and the only question that matters is whether you'll air it. Every mechanic tells a story, and the story is about the person holding the scissors.*
