# BURNBOOK -- Narrative Bible

*Written by NOVA, Narrative Designer*

*"Every mechanic tells a story, and the story of BURNBOOK is about the person holding the scissors."*

## 1. The World's Wound

Every compelling world has a scar. Find it. Press on it. Ask: where does it hurt, and who profits from the hurting?

### Defining Event

In 2000, a television show called *Survivor* premiered to 51.7 million viewers and broke American culture in half. Before that night, television pretended. Actors played roles. Scripts were written. The audience understood the contract: this is fiction, we are watching fiction, no one is really hurt. After that night, the contract changed. Real people. Real tears. Real humiliation. Produced, packaged, and broadcast into living rooms where families ate dinner and laughed. Reality television did not invent exploitation -- but it industrialized it. It built a supply chain from human vulnerability to advertising revenue, and it ran that supply chain twenty-two episodes a season, fifty-two weeks a year, on every network that wanted to survive.

BURNBOOK begins five years into this revolution. The year is 2005. The machinery is mature. The audience is addicted. And someone has to feed the machine.

That someone is you.

### Central Tension

**The commodification of vulnerability versus the irreducibility of human personhood.**

The entire economy of BURNBOOK runs on a single resource: the interior lives of its cast members. Their fears, their desires, the lies they tell themselves at three in the morning -- all of it is ore to be mined, refined, and broadcast. The central tension is not whether this is wrong. The game never asks that question. The central tension is that the ore fights back. These are not spreadsheet entries. They are people with memory, dignity, breaking points, and lawyers. The system demands you treat them as content. Their humanity demands otherwise. You live in the gap.

### The Big Lie

**"It's just a show."**

Everyone in the world of BURNBOOK tells themselves this. The cast members tell themselves it when they sign the contract. The crew tells themselves it when they keep the cameras rolling during a breakdown. The network tells itself when it orders twenty-two episodes and a reunion special. The audience tells itself when it votes for who stays and who goes. And the player tells themselves it every time they drag a confessional clip into the edit timeline.

It is never just a show. The feelings are real. The damage is real. The only thing that is manufactured is the context -- and context is everything. The big lie is the engine of the entire world: the collective agreement to pretend that what happens on camera exists in a separate moral universe from what happens off it. The lie makes the machine run. Without it, everyone would have to look at what they are actually doing, and the show would stop.

### Texture

What does the player FEEL here? Not in the abstract. In the body.

**It smells like:** Cold coffee. Dry-erase markers. The chemical tang of new manila folders. Stale pizza from a craft services table at 2 AM. The faint ozone of overheating monitors.

**It sounds like:** The hum of fluorescent tubes with a slight, maddening flicker. The click-whir of tape decks rewinding. Phones ringing three rooms away that nobody answers. The tinny, compressed audio of production monitors -- voices flattened into content. A keyboard being struck too hard by someone on a deadline. The sudden, startling silence when someone says something real in a confessional and the entire control room stops breathing.

**It feels like:** The synthetic warmth of a windowless room with too many monitors. The gritty texture of a manila folder tab under your thumb. The weight of a production binder stuffed with call sheets, release forms, psychological evaluations. The particular exhaustion of 3 AM in an office where the sun never enters and the lights never change -- where time is measured not in hours but in episodes, and episodes are measured in moments of human weakness successfully captured on tape.

**It looks like:** Blue-grey monitor light painting the walls of dark rooms. Red RECORDING indicators glowing like coals. The specific visual clutter of mid-2000s media production: Post-it notes in six colors, Sharpie-labeled VHS tapes stacked on shelves, Nielsen printouts with coffee rings, headshot photos paper-clipped to personality assessments, whiteboards covered in episode arcs drawn in three colors of marker with angry corrections in a fourth.

## 2. World-Building

### Geography

The world of BURNBOOK is deliberately claustrophobic. These are not open fields or vast cities. These are rooms -- controlled environments where human behavior is observed, recorded, and harvested.

**The Production Suite** -- The player's home. A sprawling, windowless complex of interconnected rooms that functions as the nerve center of the show. This is where every decision is made and every consequence is absorbed. It contains:

- **The Control Room:** Banks of monitors showing live feeds from every camera in the house. This is the panopticon -- the place where you watch people who don't know you're watching (or who have learned to forget). The control room has the energy of a submarine bridge: tense, focused, everyone speaking in low voices because the microphones are always live.
- **The Edit Bay:** Two chairs, six monitors, a timeline interface that looks like a seismograph of human emotion. This is the most important room in the game. It is where events become narrative, where people become characters, where truth becomes television. The edit bay is quiet. It has to be. The work done here requires the concentration of a surgeon -- because it is surgery, performed on the living tissue of other people's stories.
- **The Showrunner's Office:** Your office. A desk buried under paper. A corkboard covered in cast photos connected by red string like a conspiracy wall (because it is one). A couch where you have slept more nights than you have slept at home. A phone that rings with network demands, legal threats, and tabloid tips. The office is where the player makes strategic decisions: casting, format changes, season arcs. It is also the only room in the game that belongs to the player alone -- and therefore the only room where the player might occasionally feel something they did not intend to feel.
- **The Casting Room:** A folding table, two chairs, a camera on a tripod. This is where potential cast members sit across from you and offer themselves up for consumption. The casting room is where the burn book begins -- those first notes, those first assessments, that first reductive act of turning a human being into a profile.

**The Set** -- The controlled environment where the cast lives and the show is filmed. The player never physically enters the set. They see it only through camera feeds on the control room monitors -- a mediated view that IS the point. The set appears differently depending on the show format:

- **House of Strangers** (The Real World format): A renovated loft with too many bedrooms and not enough bathrooms. A kitchen designed for confrontation (the island is too small, the knives are too visible). A confessional booth tucked into a converted closet.
- **Heartshot** (The Bachelor format): A mansion that looks expensive but feels hollow. Rose ceremonies in a room designed to maximize anxiety. Date locations that manufacture intimacy through spectacle.
- **The Isle** (Survivor format): A beach camp with deliberately scarce resources. Tribal council set with firelight that makes everyone look dramatic. Challenge arenas where physical competition becomes emotional theater.
- **Runway War** (America's Next Top Model format): A converted warehouse with a catwalk, a panel desk, and a holding room where contestants wait to be judged. The lighting is designed to be flattering from one angle and devastating from another.

**The Network** -- An unseen but omnipresent force. The network exists as phone calls, memos, faxes, and the occasional in-person visit from a suit who speaks entirely in ratings projections and demographic data. The network is the sky of this world: always above you, always watching, impossible to ignore.

**The Tabloid Ecosystem** -- The world outside the production suite, represented through newspaper clippings, gossip blog screenshots (it is 2005; TMZ has just launched), and entertainment news tickers. This is where your show's impact on the world is measured and where past decisions resurface as headlines.

### History

The timeline of this world is the timeline of American reality television, compressed and heightened:

- **The Pre-Camera Age (Before 2000):** Television was fiction. Audiences understood the contract. Then *Survivor* aired, and the contract burned.
- **The Gold Rush (2000-2003):** Every network scrambles to produce reality programming. Formats proliferate wildly. The audience is insatiable. Production companies spring up overnight, staffed by people who have no training in handling the psychological wellbeing of their cast because no such training exists. This is the era that built the machine the player inherits.
- **The Maturation (2003-2005):** The formats solidify. The audience becomes sophisticated -- they understand the grammar of reality television, they can read the edits, they know what a "villain edit" looks like. This means the producer must become more sophisticated too. The arms race between producer manipulation and audience literacy is the competitive landscape the player enters.
- **The Present (2005):** This is where the player begins. The machine is running. The audience is enormous. The ethical questions have been asked and answered with Nielsen ratings. What remains is the work: cast, produce, edit, broadcast, survive.

### Culture

The culture of BURNBOOK's world is the culture of mid-2000s American media production, rendered with loving, unflinching specificity:

- **The Crew:** Camera operators, sound technicians, assistant producers, story editors. They are professionals who have developed a specific emotional callus -- the ability to witness human suffering through a viewfinder and evaluate it for broadcast quality. They are not monsters. They are workers. The distinction matters.
- **The Cast:** People who have volunteered to be observed, knowing and not-knowing what that means. They come from auditions, open calls, agent submissions, and the occasional street casting. They have signed release forms that their lawyers (if they have lawyers) have told them not to sign. They are brave, or desperate, or narcissistic, or some mixture of all three that the burn book will attempt to quantify and the show will attempt to exploit.
- **The Network Executives:** They speak a language made entirely of numbers, demographics, and risk assessments. They do not use the word "person." They use the word "talent." They do not use the word "exploitation." They use the word "content." They are not villains. They are the weather.
- **The Audience:** The unseen millions who watch. They are represented in the game as data -- Nielsen ratings, social media sentiment, focus group results -- but they are the gravity well around which everything orbits. Everything the player does is ultimately for them. Everything the player does is ultimately because of them.

### Rules

The world of BURNBOOK operates on rules that the player must internalize:

1. **The camera changes behavior.** No one acts the same when they know they are being recorded. Some people perform. Some people freeze. Some people forget. The camera is not a passive observer; it is an active participant in every scene. This is mechanical: cast members have a "camera awareness" stat that modifies their behavior in filmed environments.
2. **Context is sovereign.** The same footage, edited differently, tells a different story. A smile can be gratitude or cruelty depending on what comes before and after it. This is the foundational rule of the edit bay and the philosophical core of the game.
3. **People remember.** Cast members have persistent memory. What you did in episode three will surface in episode nine. What you aired in season one will echo in season four. The world accumulates consequence like sediment.
4. **Stress is a resource that depletes the container.** You can push a cast member to their breaking point and harvest the footage. But the breaking point is real, the damage is real, and a broken cast member produces diminishing returns until they produce nothing at all.
5. **The audience is never wrong and never right.** Audience sentiment is the ultimate metric, but audiences are fickle, contradictory, and capable of turning on you for the same behaviors they rewarded last week. You cannot control them. You can only read them and respond.
6. **The show must go on.** There is always another episode to produce, another ratings target to hit, another network note to address. The machinery does not pause for moral reflection. The machinery does not pause at all.

### Secrets

What is hidden in this world? What does the player discover by looking closely, by reading between the lines, by paying attention when the game assumes they are not?

- **The cast members talk to each other about you.** Not on camera. In whispered conversations in blind spots that your surveillance cannot reach. They develop theories about your strategy. They warn each other. They form alliances against you. This information surfaces in the burn book as rumors, half-heard fragments, changes in behavior that your profiles cannot explain.
- **The crew has opinions.** Your camera operators, your editors, your assistant producers -- they see what you do. They do not have the power to stop you, but they have the power to judge. Crew morale is a hidden variable that affects the quality of footage captured, the options available in the edit bay, and the likelihood that someone leaks to the press.
- **The network has a burn book too.** The network is profiling you. Your patterns, your tendencies, your reliability. This dossier determines what shows you are offered, what budget you receive, and how long the leash is before they replace you.
- **Former cast members do not disappear.** They exist after your show in a simulated ecosystem of tabloid culture, talk shows, and social media. Their trajectories are shaped by what you did to them. Some thrive. Some do not. Their stories continue whether you are watching or not -- and sometimes they intersect with your current season in ways you did not anticipate.
- **There is a confessional in your edit bay.** Not literally. But the game tracks something -- a hidden metric, never shown to the player as a number -- that measures the cumulative distance between the raw footage and the broadcast version. How much reality have you cut away? How much fiction have you inserted? The game knows. It never tells you. But the world responds to it in ways you will feel before you understand.

## 3. Characters

In BURNBOOK, every cast member is procedurally generated from interlocking trait systems. But the archetypes are the bones beneath the skin -- the patterns the player learns to recognize, exploit, and occasionally be surprised by. Each archetype below represents a category of person who enters the machine, and each has been fully realized as a character the player might encounter in their first season of *House of Strangers*.

Who is this character when no one is watching? What is the lie they tell themselves? Where does the world crack when they crack? These are the questions that matter.

### Jade Mosley -- "The Sweetheart"

- **Name and Role:** Jade Mosley, 24, former childhood pageant queen from Savannah, Georgia. Cast as the ingenue, the audience surrogate, the one you root for.
- **Desire:** To be loved. Not liked -- loved. She wants the audience to see her and feel protective of her. She wants to win, but only if winning means being chosen.
- **Need:** To learn that she exists when no one is watching. That personhood is not performance. That being alone in a room does not mean being nothing.
- **Wound:** Her mother entered her in pageants from age four and told her that being beautiful was the only thing that would keep people from leaving. Her mother left anyway, when Jade was sixteen, for a man she met online. Jade's entire psychology is organized around a single catastrophic lesson: you can do everything right and still be abandoned.
- **Lie:** "If I am good enough, no one will leave." This lie makes her endlessly exploitable. She will tolerate mistreatment because she reads it as a test of her worthiness. She will not confront people because confrontation risks rejection. She will smile through pain because she has been trained since childhood that the performance of happiness is more valuable than happiness itself.
- **Arc:** Jade enters the show as the sweetheart and, if the player exploits her, becomes a tragedy. If the player protects her, she becomes boring television. The most compelling arc -- the one an expert player will cultivate -- is the one where Jade slowly discovers she is being manipulated, and her sweetness curdles into something harder and more honest. The moment Jade stops smiling is the moment the audience holds its breath.
- **Voice:** Jade speaks in soft, deferential sentences that trail off into silence. She apologizes before she states an opinion. She uses "I feel like" as a prefix to everything, as if her feelings need permission to exist. When she is pushed to breaking, her voice does not rise. It gets quieter. The most devastating thing Jade ever says in a confessional is almost a whisper.
- **Gameplay Function:** Jade is the cast member the player is most tempted to protect and most rewarded for exploiting. Her audience favorability is high, making her a valuable asset. Her stress tolerance is low, making her a fragile one. She is the tutorial in miniature: the game's first lesson in the distance between caring about a cast member and caring for one.

**Voice Sample -- Confessional, Episode 3:**

> "I keep thinking... like... if I just say the right thing at dinner, it'll be fine? That's stupid. I know that's stupid. But I also know that Marcus looked at me today like I was -- like I was a problem he was solving. And I smiled. I just... smiled. Because that's what you do, right? That's what you do when someone looks at you like that. You smile. You make it easy for them. My mom always said, make it easy for them, and they'll stay. She didn't stay. But the advice was probably still good."

**Voice Sample -- Confrontation, Episode 7:**

> *(barely audible)* "I saw the episode. I saw what you -- what the edit -- no. No. I saw what you did. You put my confessional from Tuesday after the fight on Thursday. I wasn't talking about Marcus. I was talking about my mom. You knew that. You knew that and you used it anyway. So. So I guess my question is... was any of it real? Was any of what you showed real? Because I can't tell anymore. I actually can't tell."

---

### Marcus Cole -- "The Villain"

- **Name and Role:** Marcus Cole, 31, personal injury attorney from Atlanta. Cast as the alpha, the instigator, the one the audience loves to hate.
- **Desire:** To dominate every room he enters. To be feared, respected, and remembered. He wants to win the show in a way that makes losing to him feel like a privilege.
- **Need:** To be seen as something other than a threat. To discover that the armor he built to survive his childhood is now the prison keeping him from being loved.
- **Wound:** Raised by a single father who equated masculinity with dominance. Marcus learned early that vulnerability is a weapon other people use against you. He has never cried in front of another human being. He is thirty-one years old and he has never once said the words "I need help."
- **Lie:** "If they're afraid of me, they can't hurt me." This lie makes Marcus magnetic television. He fills every room with electricity. He makes other cast members perform at their most heightened because his presence demands it. But the lie also means that every genuine connection Marcus forms is built on quicksand -- because the moment someone gets close, Marcus will sabotage it rather than risk being seen.
- **Arc:** Marcus enters as the villain and, in the hands of a skillful player, becomes the season's most complex character. The arc that maximizes both drama and ratings is one where the audience hates Marcus for six episodes and then, in episode seven, a confessional reveals the wound beneath the armor. The audience does not forgive him. But they understand him. And understanding is more compelling than forgiveness.
- **Voice:** Marcus speaks in complete sentences with the precision of a man who argues for a living. He does not use filler words. He does not apologize. His vocabulary is deliberately elevated -- not pretentious, but controlled. He speaks the way a man speaks when he has decided that language is a weapon and he intends to be well-armed. When he is genuinely hurt, the precision fractures. The sentences get shorter. The vocabulary gets simpler. That fracture is the most honest thing about him.
- **Gameplay Function:** Marcus is the drama engine. His presence in any scene increases the probability of conflict. Pairing him with Jade is the obvious move (and the game knows it). Pairing him with Tanya is the expert move. His high televisuality and low stress tolerance create a boom-bust dynamic: he produces incredible footage until he doesn't, and the crash, when it comes, is spectacular.

**Voice Sample -- Confessional, Episode 2:**

> "Let me explain something about this house. There are people here who think that being nice is a strategy. It is not a strategy. It is the absence of a strategy. Jade smiles at everyone because Jade is terrified of everyone, and terror dressed up as kindness is still terror. I don't smile. I don't need to. When I walk into a room, every person in that room makes a decision about how they're going to handle me. That's power. That's the only thing in this house that's real."

**Voice Sample -- Confessional, Episode 7 (The Crack):**

> "My father would... no. That's not... *(long pause)*. My father was a hard man. I respected him. I respect hard men. *(another pause)*. He never hit me. I want to be clear about that. He never -- he didn't need to. He could look at you and you'd feel it. The disappointment. Like you'd failed at being a person. I haven't thought about this in... why am I talking about this. Turn the camera off. *(pause)*. Fine. Leave it on. It doesn't matter. None of this matters."

---

### Tanya Reeves -- "The Strategist"

- **Name and Role:** Tanya Reeves, 28, social media manager from Chicago. Cast as the smart one, the game-player, the meta-commentator who knows she is on a television show and treats that knowledge as an advantage.
- **Desire:** To win. Not in the emotional, abstract way the other cast members want to "win." Tanya wants to win the literal game: the audience vote, the prize money, the post-show career opportunities. She is playing chess while everyone else is playing house.
- **Need:** To discover that strategic mastery is not the same as control, and that the parts of herself she has suppressed in order to be effective -- the softness, the vulnerability, the capacity for unstrategic joy -- are not weaknesses to be managed but aspects of her humanity that she is slowly killing.
- **Wound:** Tanya grew up in a household where love was conditional on performance. Straight A's earned affection. A B+ earned silence. She internalized this completely: every relationship is transactional, every interaction has a winner and a loser, and the only way to be safe is to be smarter than everyone else in the room.
- **Lie:** "If I understand the system, the system can't hurt me." This makes Tanya a fascinating problem for the player, because she is doing what the player is doing -- reading people, predicting behavior, engineering outcomes -- from inside the fishbowl. She is the player's mirror, and mirrors are uncomfortable.
- **Arc:** Tanya's arc is about the cost of never being surprised. She enters the show with a plan for every contingency and discovers that plans cannot account for the one variable she refuses to model: her own feelings. The moment Tanya feels something unstrategic -- genuine affection for Jade, genuine respect for Marcus, genuine grief when someone is eliminated -- is the moment her armor cracks. The player's choice: exploit the crack, or let it breathe.
- **Voice:** Tanya speaks in observations rather than feelings. She narrates other people's behavior with the detachment of a nature documentary. She uses "interesting" the way other people use "wow." Her sentences have the structure of analysis: premise, evidence, conclusion. When her guard drops -- and it rarely does -- the analytical framework collapses and she speaks in fragments, startled by her own directness.
- **Gameplay Function:** Tanya is the cast member most likely to figure out the player's strategy and adjust accordingly. She reads the show's edit and modifies her behavior to control her own narrative. This makes her the most challenging cast member to manage and the most rewarding to outmaneuver. She is also the player's best potential ally: if you earn Tanya's respect (not her trust, her respect), she will produce content willingly, strategically, and brilliantly.

**Voice Sample -- Confessional, Episode 4:**

> "Three things happened at dinner tonight that the cameras caught and one thing that they didn't. The cameras caught Marcus provoking Jade. They caught Jade crying. They caught Derek comforting her, which positions Derek as the hero for episode five. What the cameras didn't catch is that Derek checked his mic pack twice before he stood up to comfort her. He wanted to make sure the audio was clean. Derek is not a hero. Derek is a producer's dream. I'm filing that away."

**Voice Sample -- Confessional, Episode 9 (The Crack):**

> "Jade got eliminated and I -- *(stops)*. I had a plan for this. I had a contingency. When she left I was supposed to... I was supposed to feel relieved because she was unpredictable and unpredictability is -- *(stops again)*. I miss her. That's not strategic. That doesn't serve any purpose. I just miss her and I don't know what to do with that."

### Derek Holloway -- "The Romantic"

- **Name and Role:** Derek Holloway, 26, high school basketball coach from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Cast as the heartthrob, the sensitive one, the love interest.
- **Desire:** To be chosen. To have someone look across a room full of people and decide that he is the one they want. He came on this show because he has never been anyone's first choice, and he is tired of being everyone's safety net.
- **Need:** To learn that being chosen by a camera is not the same as being chosen by a person, and that the validation he seeks from an audience of millions is a poor substitute for the validation he will not give himself.
- **Wound:** Derek was the reliable one in every relationship he has ever had. The steady one. The one who stayed. His high school girlfriend left him for his best friend. His college girlfriend left him for a job in another city. His last girlfriend left him for no reason she could articulate, which was worse than all the reasons combined. Derek is not bitter. He is something more dangerous: he is hopeful. He believes, against all evidence, that love is real and that it will happen to him on camera because at least on camera it has to happen to someone.
- **Lie:** "This time will be different because this time everyone is watching." The lie makes Derek simultaneously the most sincere and most tragic cast member. He genuinely opens his heart on camera because he genuinely believes that visibility equals validity. The audience roots for him. The player knows that rooting for Derek and exploiting Derek are not mutually exclusive.
- **Arc:** Derek's arc is a love story -- but the question is whether the love story is real or manufactured. If the player pairs him with another cast member, Derek will invest fully, openly, recklessly. If the player then uses that investment for ratings -- airing private moments, engineering jealousy, manufacturing obstacles -- Derek's arc becomes about what happens when love is performed for an audience. Does the performance kill the feeling? Or does the feeling survive the performance? The answer depends on the player's choices, and neither answer is comfortable.
- **Voice:** Derek speaks plainly, without flourish. He uses the vocabulary of a man who coaches teenagers: direct, encouraging, occasionally corny. He says "I believe" without irony. He says "I care about you" to people he has known for eleven days. His sincerity is disarming because it is real, and it is real because Derek does not know how to be any other way. When he is hurt, he does not get angry. He gets quiet. He stops making eye contact. He starts sentences with "I just thought..." and never finishes them.
- **Gameplay Function:** Derek is the romance engine. He generates love stories that audiences crave and sponsors pay for. Pairing Derek with a compatible cast member produces consistent, reliable, advertiser-friendly content. But Derek's genuine emotional investment means that romance arcs involving him have real consequences: breakups are devastating, betrayals are catastrophic, and if Derek walks off the show because his heart was broken on camera, the audience turns on the showrunner.

**Voice Sample -- Confessional, Episode 5:**

> "She looked at me tonight and I... I know how this sounds. I know people at home are probably like, 'it's been two weeks, calm down.' But two weeks in here is like two months out there. Everything is -- everything is more. And when she looked at me, I just thought: this is it. This is the thing I came here for. Not the show. Not the cameras. Her. I came here for her and I didn't even know it."

**Voice Sample -- Confessional, Episode 10 (The Crack):**

> "I just thought... *(long silence)*. I just thought if I was honest enough, it would... I just thought honesty was enough. It's not, is it. Being honest on a television show isn't the same as being honest. Being honest on a television show is just... giving them more footage."

### Ricki Salazar -- "The Wildcard"

- **Name and Role:** Ricki Salazar, 23, aspiring comedian and bartender from Las Vegas. Cast as the unpredictable one, the lightning rod, the person who says things that make the network's legal department send emails at 11 PM.
- **Desire:** To be famous. Not respected, not understood, not loved -- famous. Ricki wants to be a name that strangers recognize, and she does not particularly care what those strangers think of that name.
- **Need:** To understand that the distinction between fame and infamy is not trivial, and that the person she is becoming on camera is not a character she can take off when the cameras stop.
- **Wound:** Ricki's parents are normal. Her childhood was normal. She grew up in Henderson, Nevada, in a beige house on a beige street and felt nothing. The wound is not trauma. The wound is invisibility. Ricki has never been special, and the terror of being ordinary -- of living and dying without anyone noticing -- drives her to set herself on fire in public because at least fire is interesting.
- **Lie:** "Any attention is good attention." This lie makes Ricki the most volatile element in any scene. She will escalate. She will provoke. She will say the thing no one else will say, not because she is brave but because she has made a calculation that being the person who says the unsayable is better than being the person no one talks about.
- **Arc:** Ricki enters as comic relief and, if the player pushes her, becomes a cautionary tale. The arc the game rewards most is the slow revelation that Ricki's wildcard behavior is not spontaneous -- it is desperate. The moment the audience sees through the performance to the ordinary, frightened person underneath is the moment Ricki either finds something real to hold onto or spirals into a breakdown that produces spectacular, unwatchable television.
- **Voice:** Ricki talks fast, talks loud, talks over people. She uses profanity as punctuation. She makes jokes when things are serious and gets serious when things are funny. Her voice has the energy of someone who is terrified of dead air because dead air is where ordinariness lives. When she is alone in the confessional, and the performance drops, and she is just Ricki from Henderson sitting in a closet talking to a camera, her voice is softer than you expected. Younger.
- **Gameplay Function:** Ricki is high risk, high reward. She generates viral moments, social media spikes, and the kind of unpredictable behavior that produces footage you could never script. She also generates legal liability, cast instability, and the ever-present risk of a public breakdown that turns the audience against the show. Ricki's stress meter climbs faster than anyone else's, and her breaking point, when it arrives, sends shrapnel into every storyline she touches.

**Voice Sample -- Confessional, Episode 1:**

> "Okay, first of all? This house is insane. Marcus is in there acting like he's on *Law & Order*, Jade is smiling at people like she's running for prom queen in a horror movie, and Derek is -- Derek is so earnest it's actually uncomfortable. Like, sir, this is a television show. We are all going to be edited into characters. Can we at least be honest about that? No? Just me? Cool. Cool cool cool. At least I know where I stand. I stand in the blast radius. That's where the cameras point."

**Voice Sample -- Confessional, Episode 8 (The Crack):**

> "I called my mom last night. On the house phone. I wasn't supposed to but I... I called her and she said, 'Honey, we're watching every episode, we're so proud of you.' And I -- *(voice breaks)*. She's proud of me. She's proud of the person on the show. But that person isn't -- that person is -- *(long pause)*. Am I even still in here? Under all of this? I don't know. That's not a bit. I actually don't know."

### Omar Winslow -- "The Ghost"

- **Name and Role:** Omar Winslow, 34, librarian and amateur poet from Portland, Maine. Cast as... nobody is sure why Omar was cast. He is quiet. He is watchful. He does not generate drama. The editors do not know what to do with him. He is the person the audience forgets exists until suddenly, devastatingly, they don't.
- **Desire:** To observe. Omar came on the show because he wanted to understand something about human behavior in captivity -- the way people perform, the way they break, the way the camera transforms them. He is writing about this experience in a journal that the cameras have not found.
- **Need:** To participate. To stop watching from the margins and risk being seen, being known, being wrong. To discover that observation without participation is its own kind of cowardice -- a way of being in the world without being of it.
- **Wound:** Omar's older brother was charismatic, loud, and beloved. Omar was the quiet one who stood in the shadow and studied the shadow. His brother died in a car accident when Omar was nineteen, and Omar has spent fifteen years in the audience of his own life, watching, never stepping on stage, because the last person he watched step on stage did not come home.
- **Lie:** "I am here to watch, not to be watched." This lie makes Omar invisible for most of the season -- and that invisibility is itself a dramatic device. The audience forgets about Omar. The other cast members forget about Omar. And then, in a confessional in episode eight, Omar says four sentences that reframe everything that has happened, and the audience realizes that the most observant person in the house has been the one no one was observing.
- **Arc:** Omar's arc is about emergence. He moves from the periphery to the center, not through conflict but through revelation. When Omar finally speaks -- really speaks -- it has the force of testimony. His arc challenges the player's assumptions about what makes good television: is drama always the loudest thing in the room? Or is the quiet person in the corner, the one who has been watching everything, the real story?
- **Voice:** Omar speaks rarely and precisely. He uses silence the way other cast members use volume. His sentences are short, complete, and chosen with the care of someone who treats language as material. He does not waste words. When he describes what he has seen, it has the clarity of poetry -- not flowery, but exact. The kind of exactness that makes you realize you have been looking at something for weeks without seeing it.
- **Gameplay Function:** Omar is the sleeper. He generates almost no usable footage for the first half of the season, making him a wasted roster spot for beginners. Expert players recognize his value: Omar's rare confessionals are the most quotable, most viral, most critically acclaimed content in the game. His presence in a scene does not create drama -- it deepens it. He is the cast member the critics write about, the one who gives your show artistic credibility, the one who makes the audience think they are watching something important. He is also the cast member most likely to see through your manipulation and say so on camera, with the quiet precision of someone who has been taking notes.

**Voice Sample -- Confessional, Episode 8:**

> "I have been here for fifty-three days. In that time, I have watched seven people become characters. Jade became the victim. Marcus became the villain. Derek became the lover. Ricki became the chaos. Tanya became the strategist. And I became nothing -- the empty space the cameras skip over. But here is what I have noticed from the empty space: every one of them was cast as a type. And every one of them has spent fifty-three days trying to either fulfill that type or escape it. None of them chose the type. It was chosen for them. By the casting room. By the edit. By the person behind the cameras who needed a sweetheart and a villain and a love story to fill twenty-two episodes. They are performing roles in a play they did not write. And so, I think, am I. The role I was given is 'the one who watches.' But watching is not innocence. Watching is its own kind of participation. I have been the audience inside the show, and the audience is never innocent."

## 4. Tone Guide

### Adjectives

**Intimate. Institutional. Complicit. Knowing. Aching.**

The tone of BURNBOOK is the tone of a documentary that respects its subject enough to show it honestly and loves it enough to grieve what it reveals. It is not satirical. It is not preachy. It is not cynical. It is the tone of someone who has worked in the machine and understands both its seduction and its cost.

### Tone References

- **Film:** *Nightcrawler* (2014) -- the intimacy of exploitation as craft. *Network* (1976) -- the prophecy of entertainment eating reality. *The Truman Show* (1998) -- the horror beneath the wholesome surface. *Broadcast News* (1987) -- the human cost of making the news, and the way competence and conscience collide.
- **Television:** *UnREAL* (Season 1) -- the behind-the-scenes reality of reality TV production. *The Office* (UK) -- the way institutional banality creates its own particular cruelty. *Succession* -- the way power warps every relationship it touches.
- **Games:** *Papers, Please* -- moral compromise as core mechanic, bureaucracy as complicity. *Orwell* -- surveillance as gameplay, intimacy as tool. *The Westport Independent* -- editorial choice as authorial violence.
- **Books:** *Reality Bites Back* by Jennifer L. Pozner -- the industry critique. *The Program* by Suzanne Young -- the commodification of feelings. Joan Didion's *The White Album* -- the particular loneliness of watching America from inside its machinery.

### Dialogue Rules

1. **No one in BURNBOOK speaks in exposition.** Characters do not explain the premise to each other. They live in it. The player learns the world by eavesdropping, not by being lectured.
2. **Confessionals are the only honest space -- and even they are compromised.** The confessional is where characters speak most candidly, but they are still speaking to a camera. The tension between honesty and performance exists in every confessional line.
3. **Production dialogue is professional and euphemistic.** Crew members and network executives do not say "let's exploit her trauma." They say "let's give her an opportunity to share her story." The euphemism IS the violence. The gap between what is said and what is meant is where the tone lives.
4. **Cast dialogue is naturalistic and messy.** People interrupt each other. They trail off. They say "like" and "um" and "I don't know" because real people do. The cast does not speak in polished television dialogue -- the editing process polishes it after.
5. **Humor is allowed but never at the expense of the characters' humanity.** The game can be darkly funny. The production office banter, the absurdity of network notes, the comedy of cast members who are obviously performing -- all of this is fair game. But the laughter should catch in the player's throat occasionally. The moment humor and horror share the same beat is the moment the tone is correct.
6. **Silence is dialogue.** The pause before a character answers. The confessional where someone sits for ten seconds before speaking. The moment in the edit bay when the player watches raw footage and there is nothing but a person breathing in a room. Silence carries more meaning than any line of dialogue in this game.

### What This World Is NOT

- **It is not a satire.** Satire requires distance. BURNBOOK demands intimacy. The player is not laughing at the machine. The player IS the machine.
- **It is not a morality play.** The game does not punish the player for being manipulative. It does not reward the player for being kind. It shows consequences. Consequences are not the same as judgments.
- **It is not camp.** The mid-2000s reality TV aesthetic could easily slide into camp or irony. BURNBOOK treats it with sincerity. The fluorescent lights, the Nielsen reports, the VHS tapes -- these are not jokes. They are the texture of a world that took itself seriously, and the game must take that world seriously too.
- **It is not grimdark.** There is genuine warmth in this world. Cast members form real friendships. The crew cares about each other. The editing bay, at 3 AM, when you find the perfect cut that makes a scene sing -- there is joy in that. The game acknowledges the artistry of production even as it interrogates the ethics. It is not all darkness. But the light has the specific quality of fluorescent tubes: clinical, unflattering, and always on.
- **It is not a power fantasy without weight.** The player has enormous power. But the game ensures that power has texture, friction, and consequence. This is not a sandbox for cruelty. It is a simulation of an industry where cruelty and craft are inextricable, and the player must live in that entanglement.

### Sample Passages

**Production Note -- Episode 4, Scene 12 (Dinner Scene):**

> PLACEMENT: Jade (Seat 2), Marcus (Seat 3), Derek (Seat 7), Tanya (Seat 8), Ricki (Seat 5), Omar (Seat 1).
>
> CATALYST: Marcus has been informed that Jade made a comment about his legal career in a confessional three days ago. The comment was taken out of context. Marcus does not know this. Jade does not know Marcus knows.
>
> PRODUCER NOTE: Jade's stress is at 67%. Her conflict-avoidance threshold triggers at 70%. If Marcus confronts her, she will not fight back. She will absorb. Camera 3 should stay on her face. That's where the episode lives.
>
> The audience will see this as Marcus being cruel and Jade being brave. The raw footage will show something more complicated: Marcus is hurt and doesn't know how to say so. Jade is terrified and doesn't know how to leave. Both of them are performing versions of themselves that the show requires, and neither of them chose the role.
>
> Air it.

**Tabloid Clipping -- Between Season 2 and Season 3:**

> **WHERE IS JADE MOSLEY NOW?**
>
> *Former "House of Strangers" fan favorite spotted in Savannah*
>
> Six months after her tearful exit from the hit reality show, Jade Mosley has returned to her hometown of Savannah, Georgia, where sources say she is working at a nonprofit and "trying to figure out who she is without the cameras." Friends describe Mosley as "different" since the show -- quieter, less trusting, prone to flinching when recognized in public. "She gave that show everything," said one friend who asked not to be named. "And then she watched them turn it into something she didn't recognize."
>
> Mosley's representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Season 3 of *House of Strangers* premieres Tuesday at 9/8 central.

**Edit Bay -- Internal Monologue / UI Text:**

> TIMELINE: Episode 6, Act 2. Raw footage: 4 hours, 23 minutes. Broadcast slot: 11 minutes.
>
> You have Derek's confession from the rooftop. You have Jade's reaction shot from the kitchen (a different day, a different context, but the eyeline matches). You have Ricki's joke from the hot tub that, placed after Derek's confession, makes him look naive. You have Marcus watching from the hallway, and the ambient audio catches him saying something under his breath that might be "pathetic" or might be "classic" -- the production monitor audio is unclear.
>
> You have eleven minutes. You have to choose what this means.
>
> One version of this scene is a love story. Another version is a comedy. Another version is a tragedy. The footage is the same. The story is yours.
>
> What does the player FEEL here? Power. Authorship. And the faintest, most easily ignored whisper that authorship over someone else's life is not the same as authorship over a story.

## 5. Narrative-Mechanic Integration

Every mechanic tells a story. In BURNBOOK, the mechanics do not deliver narrative -- they ARE narrative. The player does not experience story and then play a game. The player plays a game and the story is what they played.

### The Burn Book as Empathy Weapon

The burn book is the game's primary narrative delivery system. When the player reads a cast member's dossier -- their childhood, their fears, their psychological profile -- the player is doing two things simultaneously: gathering strategic intelligence and coming to know a person. The mechanic makes no distinction between these acts. The information that makes you empathize with Jade (her mother left when she was sixteen) is the same information that tells you how to break her (remind her of abandonment). The burn book does not ask the player to choose between empathy and exploitation. It makes them the same gesture. That is the story the mechanic tells.

### The Situation Engine as Authorial Violence

Every time the player places cast members in a scene, they are writing a story with human bodies. The placement screen -- who sits where, who knows what, what catalyst is introduced -- is a narrative composition tool disguised as a management interface. The story it tells: you are arranging lives for dramatic effect. The gap between "I'm creating a compelling scene" and "I'm engineering a human being's worst day" is a gap the mechanic refuses to acknowledge, because the world of reality television production does not acknowledge it either.

### The Edit Bay as Unreliable Narration

The edit bay is where the player becomes an unreliable narrator -- not of a story told to them, but of a story they are telling to a simulated audience. Every editorial choice -- which camera angle, which music cue, which confessional is juxtaposed with which action -- is an act of narrative construction. The story the mechanic tells: the truth is raw footage, and everything the audience sees is a version of the truth shaped by someone with an incentive. The player does not watch unreliable narration. The player commits it.

### The Ratings Engine as Audience Surrogate

The ratings are not a score. They are narrative feedback. When the Nielsen numbers come in, when the social media feed scrolls, when the network sends a note -- these are the world responding to the story the player told. The story the mechanic tells: your narrative has consequences. Not moral consequences (the game does not punish or reward). Structural consequences. The audience is a character in this story, the largest and most powerful character, and the ratings are how that character speaks.

### The Fallout System as Narrative Memory

When a former cast member appears in a tabloid headline, when a current cast member references something that happened in a previous season, when a legal letter arrives referencing footage from episode four -- the fallout system is the game's narrative memory. It is the mechanic that says: stories do not end when the episode airs. People carry them. The story the mechanic tells is the one the title promises: the burn book is a book, and books have readers, and readers remember.

### Environmental Storytelling

The production suite itself tells a story through its accumulated detail:

- The corkboard in the showrunner's office accumulates cast photos, red string, and Post-it notes across seasons -- a physical record of every strategic decision.
- The edit bay desk collects coffee cups, crumpled notes, and VHS tapes labeled with episode numbers -- a timeline of late nights and compromised choices.
- The hallway outside the control room has framed photographs of previous seasons' casts -- a memorial wall of people who passed through the machine and were changed by it.
- Crew members' desks develop personal items over time -- family photos, novelty mugs, stress balls -- reminding the player that the machine is staffed by people with lives outside the production.

## 6. Lore Hierarchy

### Need-to-Know (The player MUST understand this to play)

- You are a showrunner producing reality television in 2005.
- Cast members are AI-driven personalities with real emotional states, not scripted characters.
- The burn book contains intelligence on each cast member that enables strategic decisions.
- You manufacture drama by placing cast members in volatile situations.
- You control the narrative through the edit bay, choosing what the audience sees.
- Ratings determine your success, budget, and creative freedom.
- Cast members can break. When they break, the consequences are real and lasting.

### Want-to-Know (Enriches the experience for curious players)

- The specific history of each cast member -- their childhood, their relationships, the experiences that shaped their psychological profile.
- The dynamics between cast members that emerge over time -- alliances, rivalries, secret conversations.
- The network's internal politics -- which executives support you, which are looking for a reason to cancel.
- The tabloid ecosystem and how your show's reputation affects future casting.
- The crew's morale and how it affects production quality.
- The specific mechanics of audience segments -- what the drama addicts want versus what the justice seekers want.

### Deep Lore (Rewards dedicated fans and lore hunters)

- The hidden metric tracking the distance between raw footage and broadcast version across your entire career.
- The full post-show trajectories of eliminated cast members, discoverable through tabloid clippings and reference by later cast.
- The competing showrunner's full history, including the show that ended their career and the show that rebuilt it.
- The production suite's previous occupant -- the showrunner who had this office before you, whose show was cancelled, whose career ended, whose name is scratched into the underside of the desk you sit at.
- The crew members' backstories -- the camera operator who used to be a documentary filmmaker, the editor who has a film school thesis about the ethics of montage collecting dust in a drawer.
- Easter egg connections between cast members across seasons -- the cousin of a season-two cast member who auditions for season five, the ex-boyfriend who shows up as a surprise guest, the web of human connections that the casting room cannot fully map.

### Never-Told (Exists for internal consistency; the player never sees it)

- The full algorithm of the AI personality generation system. The player sees the output (behavior, dialogue, emotional states) but never the inputs. The cast must feel like people, not systems.
- The exact formulas that drive audience sentiment. The player sees the results (ratings, social media) but never the math. The audience must feel like a living, unpredictable force, not a solvable equation.
- The backstories of cast members that are generated but never surfaced because they were never relevant to any storyline. Every cast member has a life larger than what the show reveals, and most of that life remains private -- because that privacy is part of what the game is about.
- The internal consistency rules governing the network's decision-making. The network should feel capricious and powerful, not algorithmic.

## 7. Timeline of Major Events

This timeline represents the narrative arc of a standard BURNBOOK playthrough, not a fixed script. The player's choices determine the specifics. What follows are the structural beats the game is designed to produce.

### Pre-Season (Tutorial)

- **The Inheritance:** The player inherits the production suite from a previous showrunner whose name is never spoken directly. The office still has their notes in the margins. Their last season's ratings are framed on the wall: a cautionary 1.3 share. This is the ghost that precedes you.
- **The Network Meeting:** A phone call from the network establishing the terms: format, budget, episode count, ratings target. The network voice is warm and threatening in the way that only corporate warmth can be.
- **The Casting Sessions:** The player meets potential cast members through the casting room interface. First impressions. First burn book entries. First reductive assessments. The tutorials live here: how to read a personality profile, how to identify televisual potential, how to see a person and a character simultaneously.

### Season One: The Education

- **Episodes 1-3 (The Toybox):** The player is learning. The production suite is new. The cast is fresh. Drama is easy -- put volatile people together and watch the sparks. The ratings are decent. The player feels clever. The game is encouraging this feeling. It wants you comfortable before it makes you complicit.
- **Episodes 4-6 (The Turn):** Something unscripted happens. A cast member says something in a confessional that lands differently -- not as content but as testimony. The burn book entry you wrote on them was reductive. They are more complicated than your profile. The edit bay presents you with a choice that has no right answer: air the moment and it's incredible television. Cut it and the cast member's privacy is preserved. The game does not tell you what to do. The ratings tell you what the audience wants. What does the player FEEL here?
- **Episodes 7-9 (The Weight):** Consequences arrive. A cast member's stress breaks 80%. A legal letter appears on your desk. A tabloid runs a story about something that happened off-camera. The edit becomes harder -- not mechanically, but emotionally. You know these people now. You have read their burn book entries. You know why Jade flinches. You know why Marcus never cries. And you are using that knowledge, because the machinery does not stop.
- **Episodes 10-12 (The Finale):** The season builds to its climax. Alliance structures shatter. The romance you cultivated either pays off or implodes. The wildcard either produces the season's defining moment or its worst crisis. The finale episode is the player's masterwork -- their most complex edit, their highest-stakes broadcast. Ratings come in. The season is judged. And then: the silence after the last episode airs, when the cameras stop and the cast members go home, and the production suite is empty, and the question hangs in the fluorescent-lit air: was it worth it?

### Between Seasons (The Reckoning)

- **Tabloid Cycle:** Headlines surface about former cast members. Some are thriving. Some are not. The player sees the long tail of their choices rendered as gossip column items and entertainment news tickers.
- **Network Negotiation:** Based on season-one performance, the network offers terms for season two. Better ratings earn more budget, better cast pools, more creative freedom. Worse ratings earn tighter constraints, mandatory format changes, network-appointed cast members.
- **Reputation Assessment:** The player's showrunner reputation is updated. Are you the producer who makes art or the producer who makes spectacle? Are you known for cultivating talent or burning through it? Your reputation precedes you into every future casting room.

### Season Two and Beyond (The Deepening)

- Former cast members resurface as tabloid stories, talk show guests, and cultural reference points.
- New cast members arrive having watched previous seasons. They have expectations, strategies, and fears shaped by what they saw you do to the last group.
- The network's demands escalate. Ratings expectations climb. The machine asks for more, always more.
- The player's relationship to the mechanics deepens. What was novel becomes routine. What was routine becomes uncomfortable. What was uncomfortable becomes the job.
- The rival showrunner emerges, producing a competing show in the same timeslot. Their existence reframes the player's work as not just production but competition, and competition justifies escalation.
- The reunion special arrives: former cast members in a room together, watching clips of what you aired, reacting to the gap between what happened and what the audience saw. This is the accountability mechanic -- the moment the edit bay's narrative violence is confronted by the people it was performed upon.

### The Long Arc (Across All Seasons)

- **The First Cast Member:** Whoever the player casts first, in the first episode of the first season, becomes the narrative throughline of the entire game. Their story continues across seasons -- in tabloids, in callbacks, in the cultural memory of the simulated world. They are the person whose life the player's career is built on. The game generates echoes of their story for as long as the player plays. Not as a scripted quest. As a systemic haunting.
- **The Showrunner's Legacy:** Over time, the player accumulates a body of work. Seasons produced. Cast members launched and broken. Editing choices that defined cultural moments. The game does not score this legacy as good or bad. It presents it as a record. And the record, viewed in totality, tells the story of the person the player chose to be inside the machine.

## 8. Open Questions

These are not TODOs. They are genuine creative tensions -- areas where the narrative design is intentionally unresolved because the resolution will emerge through prototyping, playtesting, and the organic development process. NOVA does not resolve tension prematurely. NOVA holds it.

- **How explicit should the showrunner's interiority be?** The current design positions the showrunner as a blank slate -- a pair of hands, a strategic mind, a moral compass calibrated by the player's choices. But the production suite accumulates detail (the desk, the corkboard, the coffee cups) that implies a person living inside the role. How much do we lean into the showrunner as a character with their own backstory? The instinct says: less is more. Let the player project. Let the accumulated choices be the characterization. But the question remains open.

- **Where is the line between systemic haunting and scripted guilt?** The game's philosophy is that consequences should emerge from systems, not scripts. When a former cast member appears in a tabloid headline, it should feel organic, not like the game wagging its finger. But organic consequences require careful tuning -- too subtle and the player misses them, too obvious and they feel preachy. The calibration is everything.

- **How do we handle the comedy without undermining the weight?** BURNBOOK is darkly funny. The network notes, the tabloid headlines, the absurdity of reality TV production -- all of this is inherently comic. But the game also asks the player to feel the weight of their choices. Comedy and weight must coexist in the same space, the same scene, sometimes the same sentence. This is a tonal high-wire act, and the tone guide establishes the rules, but execution will require constant vigilance.

- **What is the final image?** Every great story has a last shot, a final frame, an image that encapsulates everything. For BURNBOOK, what is the image the player sees when they stop playing? Not the last screen of the game (the game has no fixed ending). The image in their mind. The feeling in their chest. The current instinct: the empty production suite after the last episode of the last season airs. The monitors dark. The burn book closed. The fluorescent lights still humming because the lights never stop. And the question, which is also the answer, which is also the wound: was it just a show? It was never just a show. It was someone's life, and you edited it.

- **How deeply should the crew function as a moral mirror?** The crew has opinions -- this is established. But how vocal should those opinions be? A camera operator who refuses to film a scene. An editor who quits. A story producer who pushes back on a placement decision. These are powerful narrative moments, but they risk positioning the game as moralizing. The crew should be a mirror, not a judge. The distinction is the difference between a game that shows you what you are doing and a game that tells you what to think about it.

- **Can the player ever truly protect a cast member?** This is the deepest design question with narrative implications. If the player chooses to shield a cast member from exploitation -- giving them favorable edits, avoiding triggering situations, respecting their boundaries -- what happens? The ratings suffer. The network complains. The audience gets bored. Protection has a cost, and that cost is the game telling the player that kindness within a system designed for exploitation is not free. But is it possible? Can you produce ethical reality television within BURNBOOK's systems? The answer should be: barely, painfully, at great cost, and never completely. Because that is the truth about the real industry, and BURNBOOK's narrative ambition is nothing less than that truth, rendered playable.

*This bible is a living document. It breathes with the game. As the systems are prototyped and the AI cast members begin to generate emergent behavior, the narrative will grow in directions this document cannot predict -- and that unpredictability is not a flaw in the design. It is the design. Every mechanic tells a story. The bible's job is to ensure that all those stories are telling the same truth, even when they are telling it differently.*

*The truth of BURNBOOK: the distance between a person and their story is measured in editorial choices, and every choice costs someone something.*

*-- NOVA*
