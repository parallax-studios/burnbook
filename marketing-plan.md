# BURNBOOK — Marketing Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Author:** HYPE (Marketing & Community Manager)
**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Status:** Pre-Production Marketing Strategy

## 0. THE MARKETING MANDATE

Let me be clear. I've watched incredible games die in obscurity because marketing started one month before launch. I've seen mediocre games thrive because they built an audience from day one. BURNBOOK has a premise that could break the internet or vanish without a trace. The difference is this document.

Here's what we're selling: the most morally complex reality TV simulator ever made, with AI-driven cast members who feel real, break real, and remember everything you did to them. This is not a niche game. This is a game that intersects reality TV culture, management sim enthusiasts, AI simulation nerds, and every single person who's ever watched The Bachelor and thought "I could manipulate this better."

Marketing doesn't start when the game ships. Marketing starts now. The Steam page goes live the moment we have a GIF of the edit bay. The Discord opens the day we announce. The devlog begins before the first prototype. We're not building hype — we're building a community that feels like they're discovering a secret the games industry doesn't want them to know.

Let's build this.

## 1. THE HOOK (ESCALATING PRECISION)

The hook exists at three levels of detail. Each one serves a different context.

### 1.1 The Five-Second Hook (The Scroll-Stopper)

**"Reality TV showrunner simulator where AI cast members have real breakdowns — and you control the edit."**

Usage: Twitter bio, Reddit thread titles, Discord server description, first line of every press email.

### 1.2 The One-Paragraph Hook (The Elevator Pitch)

**"BURNBOOK is a reality TV production simulator where you cast AI-driven personalities, engineer drama by placing volatile people in the same room, and then control the edit to decide what fifty million viewers see. The cast members aren't scripted — they form real alliances, fall into actual love, and have genuine psychological breakdowns. You know their secrets. You exploit their trauma. And the game never tells you to stop — it just shows you the ratings, the fallout, and the tabloid headlines six months later when they're still trying to recover. The Sims meets Nightcrawler, inside a 2005 television production suite."**

Usage: Steam store description (short), press kit overview, convention pitch, influencer outreach email.

### 1.3 The One-Page Hook (The Deep Dive)

**THE GAME:**

You are a reality TV showrunner in 2005, the golden age of exploitation television. You cast shows, engineer drama, and control the edit. Your cast members are AI-driven personalities with psychological profiles, stress thresholds, and memory. They don't follow scripts — they react, adapt, break, and remember.

**THE BURN BOOK:**

Your secret weapon is the burn book — a dossier on every cast member containing their childhood trauma, their insecurities, their breaking points. You use this intelligence to manufacture confrontation: seat the people who will clash at dinner, plant a letter that triggers a meltdown, engineer a love triangle that collapses in episode six.

**THE EDIT BAY:**

After shooting scenes, you enter the edit bay — a timeline interface where you assemble broadcast episodes from raw footage. You choose which moments air, which confessionals reframe them, which music cues make the audience love or hate someone. The same footage can tell a love story or a villain origin. The edit is where you wield power.

**THE CONSEQUENCES:**

Cast members track psychological integrity. Push them too hard and they break — not in a game-over sense, but in a "this person just had a genuine mental health crisis on your watch" sense. Their lawyers send letters. Tabloids run stories. Years later, they appear in your Season 4 burn book as a cautionary reference. The game doesn't punish you for exploitation. It just makes you live with it.

**THE QUESTION:**

At what point did you stop seeing them as people?

Usage: Full press kit, investor pitch, feature article interviews, crowdfunding campaign page (if applicable).

## 2. TARGET AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Primary Audience: Reality TV Critic-Fans (Ages 24-40)

**Who They Are:**

Adults who grew up during the reality TV boom (2000-2010) and now consume it with ironic distance and genuine fascination. They watch The Bachelor while live-tweeting snarky commentary. They listen to reality TV recap podcasts (*Bachelor Party*, *Rob Has a Podcast*, *Watch What Crappens*). They've read articles dissecting the ethics of reality television. They know what a "frankenbite" is. They understand producer manipulation.

**Where They Live Online:**

- Reddit: r/thebachelor, r/BravoRealHousewives, r/survivor, r/LoveIslandTV
- Twitter/X: Reality TV stan Twitter, Bachelor Nation, Bravo superfans
- Podcasts: Reality TV recap shows with 100K+ listener bases
- YouTube: Reality TV commentary channels, deep-dive analysis videos

**What They Want:**

A game that respects their intelligence. They don't want a shallow mobile game with licensed Bachelor branding. They want a simulation that acknowledges the complexity, the ethics, the craft of reality TV production. They want to feel the power of the producer and the weight of that power.

**How to Reach Them:**

NOT through traditional games press first. Reach them through reality TV media. Get the Bachelor recappers talking. Get the Housewives podcasters obsessed. Get a Polygon feature, yes — but also get a Vulture think piece. This audience doesn't follow IGN. They follow entertainment journalism. Meet them where they already are.

**Conversion Hook:**

"You know how every season of The Bachelor feels manipulated? This is the game where you're the one doing the manipulating. And it feels exactly as good and as bad as you think."

### 2.2 Secondary Audience: Management Sim Enthusiasts

**Who They Are:**

Players who love systems-driven management games. They've sunk 200 hours into *Two Point Hospital*, *Game Dev Tycoon*, *Football Manager*, *Planet Zoo*. They love optimizing loops, managing resources, balancing competing priorities. They're comfortable with dense UI and long play sessions.

**Where They Live Online:**

- Steam curators and wishlists
- r/tycoon, r/BaseBuildingGames, r/StrategyGames
- YouTube: Management sim streamers, let's players who do 40-episode series
- Discord: Genre-specific servers

**What They Want:**

Depth. They want a game that still has teeth at hour 100. They want systems that interlock in interesting ways. They want a management game with a theme that's fresh — not another hospital, not another theme park, something genuinely new.

**How to Reach Them:**

Steam is the platform. Wishlist conversion is the metric. Target them with:
- Steam tags: Simulation, Management, Story Rich, Choices Matter, Dark Comedy, Singleplayer
- Curator outreach to management sim specialists
- Feature in Steam Next Fest with a meaty demo (one full season, not a 15-minute vertical slice)
- Let's Players who cover management sims

**Conversion Hook:**

"If you loved the ethical dilemmas in *Papers, Please* and the systems depth of *RimWorld*, imagine those mechanics applied to reality TV production. You're not managing a colony — you're managing human psychology for profit."

### 2.3 Tertiary Audience: AI Simulation Enthusiasts

**Who They Are:**

Players fascinated by emergent AI behavior. They're the ones who play *The Sims* for 600 hours watching autonomous sims ruin their own lives. They play *Dwarf Fortress* for the stories. They play *RimWorld* to see what the AI colonists will do. They want characters with genuine agency, memory, and unpredictability.

**Where They Live Online:**

- r/TheSims, r/dwarffortress, r/RimWorld
- AI and procedural generation communities
- Twitch: Streamers who narrate emergent AI stories

**What They Want:**

Characters that surprise them. They want AI agents who aren't just stat blocks — they want personalities who grow, change, form relationships, and break in ways the developer didn't explicitly script. BURNBOOK's AI cast system is a selling point for this audience.

**How to Reach Them:**

Highlight the AI in marketing materials. Dev diaries about the personality generation system. GIFs showing divergent outcomes from the same setup. The language here is "emergent storytelling," "procedural characters," "unpredictable AI."

**Conversion Hook:**

"Every cast member is procedurally generated with unique psychology, relationships, and breaking points. Every season is a different cast with different dynamics. The AI doesn't follow a script — it reacts, remembers, and surprises you. No two seasons are the same."

### 2.4 Audience Gap Analysis

**The Missed Opportunity:**

There is NO good reality TV simulation game on PC. None. The audience exists — millions of reality TV viewers, many of whom play games. But they've never had a game that takes the subject seriously. Mobile games are shallow cash-grabs. Console games don't exist. PC has nothing.

BURNBOOK is entering an empty market with a massive, passionate, underserved audience. The opportunity is enormous. The risk is that this audience doesn't know they want a reality TV game until they see it — which means the marketing must show, not tell.

---

## 3. COMPARABLE POSITIONING ("X MEETS Y")

Every comp pair highlights a specific dimension of the game. Use different comps for different audiences.

### 3.1 For Reality TV Fans:

**"If UnREAL (the TV show) was a playable simulation"**

UnREAL depicted the behind-the-scenes manipulation of a Bachelor-style show. BURNBOOK is that, but you're the producer. This comp immediately communicates tone, theme, and mechanical premise to anyone who watched UnREAL.

**"The Truman Show meets The Sims"**

You're controlling lives, but the subjects don't know you're pulling the strings. (Or they do know, and that's part of the horror.) This comp works for people who understand The Truman Show's ethical dimension.

### 3.2 For Management Sim Fans:

**"Game Dev Tycoon meets Nightcrawler"**

A management sim where your incentive is to exploit human vulnerability for commercial success. The tycoon loop with moral weight.

**"Papers, Please meets Big Brother"**

A bureaucratic simulation where every choice is a moral compromise, applied to reality TV. You're not stamping passports — you're approving edits that destroy reputations.

### 3.3 For AI/Simulation Fans:

**"RimWorld meets The Bachelor"**

Emergent AI storytelling in a confined social space. You set conditions, the AI generates drama, you harvest the stories.

**"The Sims with the ethics of Nightcrawler"**

Social simulation where your goal isn't to make sims happy — it's to make them watchable. The incentive structure is inverted.

### 3.4 For Games Press:

**"Hypnospace Outlaw meets America's Next Top Model"**

Period-authentic interface (2005 production suite) wrapping a simulation with real emotional stakes. Nostalgia as mechanic, exploitation as theme.

**"If Orwell (the surveillance game) was about television production instead of state security"**

You're gathering intelligence, watching people through cameras, making decisions about their lives based on incomplete information.

---

## 4. UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITION (USP)

**THE USP:**

"No game has ever put you in the reality TV showrunner's chair with AI cast members who behave like actual people — forming real alliances, falling into real love, having real breakdowns, and remembering everything you did to them."

**Why This Matters:**

Every other "reality TV game" is a shallow dress-up simulator or a licensed mobile cash-grab. BURNBOOK is the first game to simulate the full production pipeline — casting, situation design, filming, editing, broadcasting, and fallout — with AI agents whose psychology is the core mechanic.

**The Demonstrable Difference:**

- **Mobile reality TV games:** Choose an outfit, click through dialogue. No agency.
- **The Movies (2005):** Make films, not reality TV. No ethical dimension.
- **The Sims:** Sandbox life sim. No broadcast, no audience, no edit bay.
- **BURNBOOK:** Full production pipeline. AI cast with memory and breaking points. Edit bay where you control narrative. Ratings-driven feedback loop. Long-term consequences.

**Show the Game, Not the Features:**

The USP must be demonstrable in a 15-second GIF:
- Split-screen: Left side shows raw footage (two cast members having a tender conversation). Right side shows the edit bay, where the player adds a sinister music cue and a chyron that says "BUT HE WAS LYING." Same footage. Different story. That's BURNBOOK in 15 seconds.

---

## 5. MARKETING TIMELINE (18-MONTH PLAN)

Marketing is not a launch phase. It's a parallel process that runs from first commit to post-launch year one.

### 5.1 PHASE 1: PRE-ANNOUNCEMENT (Months -18 to -12)

**Goal:** Build internal assets. Start soft community building.

**Activities:**

- **Internal Prototype:** Build the situation engine (4 AI cast, one dinner scene). Prove emergent drama works.
- **Edit Bay Prototype:** Prove the edit bay feels like authorship, not homework.
- **First Key Art:** The production suite at 3 AM. If this image doesn't make people feel something, the marketing won't either.
- **Social Media Accounts:** Create Twitter/X, TikTok, Reddit account for the game. Post nothing publicly yet — but establish the handles.
- **Soft Outreach:** Identify 10-15 reality TV podcasters/influencers. Send introductory emails (not pitches yet): "Hi, we're making a game you might find interesting. Can we stay in touch?" Build relationships before you need them.

**Budget Allocation:** $0 (pre-revenue, internal work only)

**Success Metrics:**

- Prototype demonstrates core loop in 5-minute playable session
- Key art completed and tested with 10-person focus group
- 10 influencer relationships established

### 5.2 PHASE 2: ANNOUNCEMENT (Months -12 to -9)

**Goal:** Announce the game. Generate wishlists. Build initial community.

**The Announcement:**

The announcement is not a press release. It's a fake behind-the-scenes documentary.

**Announcement Trailer (90 seconds):**

- **0:00-0:15:** Handheld camera, grainy footage. A producer's voice off-screen: "Okay, so we're making a game about reality TV. But here's the thing — we can make her the villain or the victim. It depends on the edit." Cut to: footage of a woman crying in a confessional.
- **0:15-0:30:** Cut to: the edit bay interface. A hand drags the crying clip into the timeline. Adds a music cue labeled "SINISTER STING." The tone of the scene transforms. Text overlay: "THE EDIT IS WHERE YOU DECIDE WHAT'S REAL."
- **0:30-0:50:** Quick cuts showing the game's systems: burn book pages flipping, cast members shouting at dinner, the ratings report landing on a desk, a tabloid headline: "FORMER CAST MEMBER: 'THEY DESTROYED ME.'"
- **0:50-1:15:** Voice-over (producer, matter-of-fact): "You cast the show. You engineer the drama. You control the narrative. And the cast? They remember. Every choice. Every edit. Every betrayal. The question is: how far will you go for a 2.7 share?"
- **1:15-1:30:** Title card: **BURNBOOK** in the metallic 2005 VH1 logo style. Below it: "Reality TV production simulator. Coming 2027. Wishlist now on Steam."

**Where It Drops:**

- YouTube (game's official channel, seeded to press)
- Twitter/X with the caption: "I made her cry on camera for a 2.3 ratings bump. She never forgave me. The audience never forgot."
- Reddit: r/Games, r/thebachelor, r/BravoRealHousewives, r/survivor (cross-posting with tailored titles)
- Press email blast to: Polygon, Kotaku, PC Gamer, Rock Paper Shotgun, **AND** Vulture, The AV Club, entertainment journalists who cover reality TV

**Steam Page Launch:**

Goes live the same day as the announcement. The page includes:
- Announcement trailer
- Key art (production suite at 3 AM)
- Short description (one-paragraph hook)
- 5 placeholder screenshots (mockups from art direction doc)
- Tags: Simulation, Management, Story Rich, Choices Matter, Dark Comedy, Singleplayer, Strategy, Psychological, Character-Driven
- "Coming 2027" release window

**Community Channels Open:**

- **Discord server:** Launches with 3 channels: #general, #reality-tv-fans, #game-discussion. Invite-only for first week (influencers, press, friends-and-family), then public.
- **Twitter/X:** First post is the announcement trailer.
- **Subreddit:** r/BurnbookGame created. First post: "We're making a reality TV production sim. AMA."

**Press Outreach:**

Two-pronged approach:
1. **Games press:** Standard pitch. Polygon, Kotaku, PC Gamer get embargoed interviews.
2. **Reality TV press:** Non-standard pitch. Vulture, AV Club, entertainment journalists get "we made a game about the thing you write about" angle. Offer developer interviews framed as "the ethics of reality TV, explored through game design."

**Budget Allocation:** $5,000
- Trailer production (if outsourced): $2,000
- Key art (if commissioning): $1,500
- PR tool subscriptions (media database, press email platform): $500
- Paid social media test ($20/day for 2 weeks on Twitter): $500
- Discord boost (optional): $500

**Success Metrics:**

- 5,000 Steam wishlists in first week
- 50+ articles/posts (games press + reality TV press combined)
- Discord reaches 500 members in first month
- Twitter reaches 1,000 followers in first month
- Reddit AMA gets 200+ upvotes and 50+ comments

### 5.3 PHASE 3: DEVLOG ERA (Months -9 to -6)

**Goal:** Build sustained interest. Turn followers into invested community members.

**Devlog Cadence:**

Bi-weekly devlogs, alternating format:
- **Week 1:** Written blog post (Steam community hub, mirrored to website if one exists). 500-800 words. Deep-dive on one system.
- **Week 2:** Video devlog (YouTube, 5-8 minutes). Show the system in action. Prototype footage is fine — community wants transparency, not polish.

**Devlog Topics (12 posts over 3 months):**

1. "Building the Burn Book: How We Simulate Psychological Profiles"
2. "The Situation Engine: Why Cast Members Don't Follow Scripts"
3. "Designing the Edit Bay: Authorship Without the Tedium"
4. "Why 2005? The Aesthetic and Ethics of SD-Era Reality TV"
5. "The Ratings Engine: Simulating Audience Sentiment"
6. "Fallout Systems: What Happens When You Break Someone"
7. "Casting the First Season: Procedural Characters vs. Scripted Archetypes"
8. "The Dinner Table Scene: A Case Study in Emergent Drama"
9. "Music Cues and Emotional Manipulation: Designing the Edit Bay Soundtrack"
10. "Post-Show Trajectories: The Long Tail of Your Decisions"
11. "Why We're Not Using Real Show Licenses (And Why That's Better)"
12. "Playtesting the Moral Weight: When Do Players Feel Bad?"

Each devlog ends with a question for the community: "What would you do in this situation?" Encourage discussion in Discord and Reddit.

**Community Engagement:**

- **Weekly Discord Events:** "Reality TV Watch Party" — community watches an episode of a classic reality show (The Real World, early Survivor) and discusses the production choices. Devs participate.
- **Fan Art / Fan Theories Encouraged:** Retweet/reshare fan content. Make fans feel seen.
- **AMA with NOVA (Narrative Designer persona):** Mid-phase, do a Reddit AMA about the ethical design of the game. Frame it as "I'm the narrative designer of a game about exploitation. AMA."

**Influencer Seeding (Soft):**

Reach out to 5-10 YouTubers/streamers who cover management sims or narrative-driven games. Offer early prototype access (even if it's buggy). No obligations, just "hey, we think you'd find this interesting." The goal is to get them talking organically, not doing sponsored content (yet).

**Budget Allocation:** $3,000
- Devlog video production (editing, thumbnail art): $1,500
- Community management tools (Discord bots, moderation): $500
- Influencer seeding (Steam keys, small thank-you gifts): $500
- Social media ads (continued low-level spend): $500

**Success Metrics:**

- Wishlist growth: 500-1,000 new wishlists per month
- Devlog engagement: Average 200+ views per post, 20+ comments
- Discord activity: 50+ daily active users
- Twitter growth: 2,500 followers by end of phase
- First influencer coverage: 2-3 YouTubers make organic videos

### 5.4 PHASE 4: DEMO BUILD & STEAM NEXT FEST (Months -6 to -4)

**Goal:** Playable demo. Steam Next Fest appearance. Major wishlist conversion spike.

**The Demo:**

One full season of "House of Strangers" (The Real World format). 8 episodes. Simplified cast (6 members instead of 12). Full loop: casting, scene planning, shooting, editing, broadcasting, ratings, fallout. This is not a vertical slice — this is the real game, compressed.

**Demo Scope:**

- 6 procedurally generated cast members (archetypes visible, AI-driven)
- 8 episodes (compressed: 15-20 minutes per episode instead of 25-35)
- Full burn book access
- Full edit bay (6 segments per episode)
- Simplified ratings (Nielsen number + one aggregate audience sentiment score, not full segment breakdown)
- No between-seasons management (demo ends after Season 1 finale)
- Saves do NOT transfer to full game (avoid save compatibility issues)

**Steam Next Fest:**

Apply for the festival 3 months in advance. If accepted:
- **Demo launches during the fest** (typically 7-day event)
- **Developer livestream:** 2-hour stream where devs play the demo, answer questions, discuss design decisions. Frame it as "We're the producers of a game about producers — meta."
- **Press blitz:** Coordinate with the festival launch. Every games outlet covers Next Fest. Pitch: "BURNBOOK is the most ethically complex management sim at Next Fest."

**Next Fest Marketing Plan:**

- **Pre-Fest Hype (1 week before):** Announce demo date. Post GIFs of key systems (burn book flipping, edit bay timeline, ratings reveal). Tease: "You'll be able to destroy 6 people's lives in the demo. We're excited."
- **During Fest:** Daily updates. Share player reactions (quote tweets, Reddit comments). Host Discord events: "Demo Playthrough Race — who can get the highest ratings in Season 1?"
- **Post-Fest Follow-Up (1 week after):** Thank players. Share stats: "X players made Jade cry. Y players protected her. Z players got their show cancelled." Announce next milestone (beta, release window update).

**Budget Allocation:** $8,000
- Demo QA and polish: $3,000 (external QA if needed)
- Next Fest assets (trailer, screenshots, capsule art): $2,000
- Livestream production (overlays, moderation): $500
- Paid ads during Next Fest (Steam, Twitter): $2,000
- Influencer access (send demo keys to 50+ YouTubers/streamers): $500

**Success Metrics:**

- 50,000+ demo downloads during Next Fest week
- 25,000+ new wishlists (50% conversion from demo players is ambitious but achievable for a strong demo)
- 10+ influencer videos during/after Next Fest
- Total wishlist count: 60,000+ by end of phase
- Steam user reviews of demo: "Overwhelmingly Positive" (>95% positive)

### 5.5 PHASE 5: BETA & LAUNCH PREP (Months -4 to Launch)

**Goal:** Closed beta for community. Final marketing assets. Launch day coordination.

**Closed Beta:**

- **Invitations:** Top Discord members, active Reddit contributors, influencers who've covered the game. 200-500 beta keys.
- **Beta Scope:** First 3 seasons playable. Full feature set. Bugs expected, but core loop must be solid.
- **Feedback Loop:** Weekly surveys. Discord beta-tester channel. Prioritize feedback on: edit bay usability, burn book clarity, pacing, moral weight ("did you feel bad? when?").
- **NDA:** Soft NDA. Testers can talk about the game but can't stream or share footage (prevents spoilers, maintains launch surprise).

**Final Trailer (Launch Trailer):**

90 seconds. This is the trailer that plays on the Steam page forever. It must be perfect.

**Launch Trailer Structure:**

- **0:00-0:20:** Cold open. Black screen. Text: "You cast the show." Cut to: casting room, headshots, player selecting cast members. Text: "You engineer the drama." Cut to: scene planner, dinner table setup. Text: "You control the edit." Cut to: edit bay, player cutting between footage clips.
- **0:20-0:45:** The hook. Show the edit bay split-screen moment: raw footage vs. edited version with music cue. Text overlay: "Same footage. Different story. You decide what's real."
- **0:45-1:10:** Montage of consequences. Ratings going up. Cast member stress meters in red. Tabloid headline. Confessional of a cast member saying "I saw the edit. You made me a villain." Burn book page with red annotations.
- **1:10-1:30:** Title card. Reviews quotes (if available). Release date. Platforms. "Wishlist now" CTA.

**Press Review Campaign:**

- **Review Keys:** Send to 100+ outlets 2 weeks before launch. Embargo lifts on launch day.
- **Target Outlets:** Games press (Polygon, Kotaku, PC Gamer, RPS, Eurogamer) AND entertainment press (Vulture, AV Club, Paste Magazine).
- **Pitch Angle for Entertainment Press:** "This game is a playable critique of reality TV. It's what *Black Mirror* would make if *Black Mirror* made games."
- **Influencer Keys:** Send to 200+ YouTubers/streamers. No embargo (they can post whenever). Encourage launch-day streams.

**Store Page Polish:**

- Update screenshots (final game footage, not mockups)
- Add launch trailer
- Finalize store description (use one-paragraph hook + feature list + "What critics are saying" if reviews are positive)
- Ensure tags are accurate and comprehensive
- Add system requirements

**Social Media Ramp-Up:**

- **Daily posts** in the week before launch (countdown style)
- **GIFs and clips** from the game showing key moments
- **Community spotlights:** Feature fan theories, fan art, beta tester reactions
- **Launch day thread:** Pin a "BURNBOOK IS OUT" thread on Reddit, Discord, Twitter

**Budget Allocation:** $15,000
- Beta QA and bug fixing: $5,000
- Launch trailer production: $4,000
- PR firm (optional, for broader press reach): $3,000
- Paid ads (Steam, Twitter, YouTube pre-roll): $2,000
- Influencer care packages (send thank-you gifts to top influencers): $1,000

**Success Metrics:**

- Beta feedback: Average satisfaction 8/10 or higher
- Wishlist count at launch: 100,000+ (industry rule of thumb: 10-20% of wishlists convert to week-one sales)
- Press coverage: 50+ reviews published on launch day
- Influencer coverage: 100+ videos/streams in launch week

### 5.6 PHASE 6: LAUNCH & WEEK ONE (Launch Day to Day 7)

**Goal:** Maximize visibility. Drive sales. Maintain community momentum.

**Launch Day Plan:**

- **Steam Launch:** Game goes live at 10 AM PST (1 PM EST, 6 PM UK). This timing catches US morning, EU evening, works for global streamers.
- **Launch Discount:** 10% off for first week. Not deep (we're not desperate), but enough to incentivize day-one purchases.
- **Developer Livestream:** 4-hour stream starting at launch. Devs play through a full season, answer questions, celebrate with community. High production value: overlays, guest appearances (maybe a reality TV podcaster?), giveaways (free game keys every 30 minutes).
- **Social Media Blitz:** Post every 2-3 hours. Share player reactions, funny moments, impressive ratings achievements. Retweet influencer streams.
- **Press Follow-Up:** Email thank-yous to every outlet that reviewed. Share their reviews on social media. Build relationships for future coverage (DLC, updates, etc.).

**Week One Tactics:**

- **Daily Discord Events:** "Highest Ratings Challenge," "Most Ethical Showrunner Award," "Biggest Scandal Screenshot Contest"
- **Reddit AMA:** Day 3 post-launch. Devs answer questions about design, development, and the ethics of the game.
- **Patch 1.01:** Day 5-7. Fix any critical launch bugs. Communicate transparently about fixes. Show the community you're responsive.
- **User-Generated Content Encouragement:** Ask players to share their burn book pages, their most dramatic moments, their tabloid headlines. Create a hashtag: #BurnbookStories

**Budget Allocation:** $5,000
- Launch day livestream production: $1,500
- Community event prizes (game keys, merch if it exists): $1,000
- Emergency PR (if needed for crisis management): $1,500
- Continued paid ads (amplify strong launch): $1,000

**Success Metrics:**

- Week-one sales: 10,000-20,000 copies (conservative, based on 100K wishlists and 10-20% conversion)
- Steam user reviews: 500+ reviews, 85%+ positive ("Very Positive" rating)
- Concurrent players peak: 2,000+ (indicates strong word-of-mouth)
- Social media mentions: 5,000+ tweets/posts using #BURNBOOK or #BurnbookGame
- Twitch viewership: 10,000+ hours watched in week one

### 5.7 PHASE 7: POST-LAUNCH (Months 1-6)

**Goal:** Sustain momentum. Build long-tail sales. Grow community.

**Content Roadmap:**

- **Month 1:** Patch 1.1 (balance adjustments based on player feedback, QoL improvements). Announce roadmap for future updates.
- **Month 2:** Free content update: New show format (e.g., "Runway War" — America's Next Top Model parody). Press release, trailer for the update.
- **Month 3:** Community event: "Design a Cast Member" contest. Players submit personality profiles, the devs pick 10 to add to the procedural generation pool (with credit). Builds ownership.
- **Month 4:** Major update: Stretch goal feature if feasible (Rival Showrunner, Reunion Special, etc.). If not, another format + QoL improvements.
- **Month 5-6:** Evaluate DLC vs. sequel vs. moving on. If sales are strong (50K+ copies), consider paid DLC. If sales are modest (10-20K), focus on building community for a sequel.

**Ongoing Marketing:**

- **Bi-weekly devlogs** continue (but shift from "how we built it" to "what we're adding")
- **Monthly community spotlights:** Feature interesting player stories, fan creations, high-achievement runs
- **Sale participation:** Steam seasonal sales (Summer, Autumn, Winter). Discount deepens over time (10% → 20% → 33%).
- **Award submissions:** Submit to IGF, IndieCade, SXSW Gaming, BAFTA Games Awards (Debut Game category). Wins = free press.
- **Press outreach for milestones:** "BURNBOOK hits 50K sales" press release. "BURNBOOK wins [award]" announcement.

**Budget Allocation (per month):** $2,000
- Continued social media ads: $1,000/month
- Community management (part-time CM if needed): $500/month
- Update trailer production: $500/month

**Success Metrics (6-month):**

- Total sales: 50,000+ copies
- Active Discord members: 2,000+
- Steam reviews: 2,000+, maintaining 85%+ positive
- Ongoing coverage: 1-2 articles/videos per month from press/influencers
- Community retention: 200+ daily active Discord users 6 months post-launch

## 6. STORE PAGE COPY (STEAM)

### 6.1 Short Description (300 characters max)

"Cast reality TV shows with AI-driven personalities, engineer drama by exploiting their psychology, then control the edit to decide what America sees. The Sims meets Nightcrawler in a 2005 production suite. They remember everything you did. Do you?"

### 6.2 Long Description

**YOU ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS PERSON IN TELEVISION.**

Welcome to 2005. Reality TV is eating American culture alive, and you're the one feeding the machine.

**CAST THE SHOW:**
Select cast members from procedurally generated personalities. Every candidate has a psychological profile, a wound, a secret. Choose wisely — or choose chaos.

**ENGINEER THE DRAMA:**
You don't script reality TV. You set the conditions. Seat enemies at dinner. Plant a letter from home. Pour champagne when tensions are high. Introduce a surprise ex. The AI resolves the scene. You harvest the wreckage.

**CONTROL THE EDIT:**
Raw footage is truth. The broadcast is your version. Cut between camera angles. Add confessional overlays. Choose the music cue that reframes a smile as a smirk. Write the chyron that makes someone a villain. The edit bay is where you wield power.

**FACE THE CONSEQUENCES:**
Cast members aren't content — they're people. They track stress. They remember betrayals. Push too hard and they break. Their lawyers send letters. Tabloids run stories. Years later, you see their name in a headline and remember: you did that.

**MANAGE THE RATINGS:**
Nielsen numbers. Audience segments. Advertiser confidence. Network demands. You're not just making television — you're balancing five competing priorities while keeping your cast functional enough to air episode eight.

**THE QUESTION THE GAME NEVER ASKS:**
At what point did you stop seeing them as people?

**FEATURES:**
- **AI-Driven Cast:** Every personality is procedurally generated with unique psychology, relationships, stress thresholds, and memory. No two seasons are the same.
- **The Burn Book:** A living dossier on every cast member. Intel degrades. Profiles age. People change under pressure. Maintenance is the job.
- **The Situation Engine:** Combinatorial drama manufacturing. Placement + catalysts + information asymmetry = volatile scenes with emergent outcomes.
- **The Edit Bay:** Timeline-based editing interface. Choose moments, add confessionals, select music cues, write chyrons. Assemble episodes. Author meaning.
- **The Ratings Engine:** Simulated audience with five distinct segments. Advertisers who want brand safety. A network who wants numbers. Triangulate or die.
- **The Fallout System:** Post-show trajectories. Tabloid coverage. Legal threats. Former cast members haunting your future seasons. Every choice compounds.
- **Multi-Season Career Mode:** Build a reputation. Unlock better cast, formats, and tools. Your legacy is the sum of everyone you launched — and everyone you broke.

**MATURE CONTENT DESCRIPTION:**
This game depicts psychological manipulation, emotional distress, and the commodification of human vulnerability. Themes include exploitation, mental health crises, and the ethics of reality television production. No graphic violence or sexual content, but the game's subject matter may be disturbing.

## 7. SOCIAL MEDIA PLAN

### 7.1 Platform Strategy

**Twitter/X (Primary Platform):**

Why: Reality TV fans live on Twitter. Bachelor Nation, Bravo Twitter, Survivor strategists — this is where they discuss, dissect, and meme. Twitter is the platform for hooking this audience.

**Content Mix:**
- 40%: Game clips, GIFs, screenshots (show the game)
- 30%: Reality TV commentary and memes (build community, show we understand the culture)
- 20%: Dev insights, behind-the-scenes (build authenticity)
- 10%: Community spotlights, fan content (build ownership)

**Posting Cadence:**
- Pre-announcement: 0 posts (account exists but silent)
- Announcement to launch: 3-5 posts per week
- Launch week: 3-5 posts per day
- Post-launch: 1-2 posts per day

**Voice:**
Knowing, self-aware, slightly complicit. We're not above the exploitation — we're examining it. Example tweet: "The editing bay has a button labeled 'MAKE VILLAIN.' It doesn't actually do anything. You were already making a villain. The button is just honest about it."

**TikTok (Secondary Platform):**

Why: Younger audience. Viral potential. Reality TV recap TikTok is huge.

**Content Types:**
- 15-30 second clips showing dramatic moments from the game
- "POV: You're the producer and you just made someone cry for ratings" format
- Before/After edits: raw footage vs. broadcast version
- "Day in the life of a reality TV showrunner" (in-game footage cut like a TikTok day-in-the-life)

**Posting Cadence:**
- 2-3 posts per week during pre-launch
- Daily during launch week
- 3-4 posts per week post-launch

**Reddit (Community Platform):**

Why: Deep discussions. Reality TV subreddits have massive, engaged audiences.

**Subreddits to Target:**
- r/Games, r/gaming, r/pcgaming (for announcements)
- r/thebachelor, r/BravoRealHousewives, r/survivor (for reality TV crossover audience)
- r/tycoon, r/StrategyGames (for management sim fans)
- r/BurnbookGame (our own subreddit, for community)

**Content Strategy:**
- AMAs during key milestones (announcement, Next Fest, launch)
- Devlogs cross-posted from Steam
- Community discussions: "How would you cast this season?" "What's the most ethical way to produce reality TV?"
- Meme-friendly content (encourage fan memes, reshare the best)

**Discord (Retention Platform):**

Why: Community hub. Voice chat during events. Retention engine.

**Server Structure:**
- **#announcements** (read-only, dev posts only)
- **#general** (open chat)
- **#reality-tv-fans** (off-topic: discuss actual reality TV)
- **#game-discussion** (strategy, tips, experiences)
- **#burn-book-showcase** (share screenshots of cast profiles, dramatic moments)
- **#feedback** (structured feedback for devs)
- **#fan-creations** (art, videos, memes)

**Events:**
- Weekly watch parties (classic reality TV episodes)
- Monthly design challenges ("Design a show format," "Cast the perfect season")
- Launch week: daily events and giveaways

### 7.2 Content Calendar (Sample Week, Pre-Launch)

**Monday:** Devlog post (Twitter thread + link to full blog)
**Tuesday:** Meme/reaction GIF from reality TV with caption tying to the game
**Wednesday:** Screenshot showcase: "This is the burn book entry for Marcus. His wound: a father who equated masculinity with dominance. His lie: if they're afraid of me, they can't hurt me. What would you do with this information?"
**Thursday:** Community question: "You have footage of a genuine breakdown. It's incredible television. It's also someone's worst day. Do you air it?" (Encourage replies)
**Friday:** Clip from the game (15-second edit bay moment, music cue transformation)
**Saturday:** Retweet/share community content
**Sunday:** Reality TV recap/commentary (connect the game to the culture)

### 7.3 Hashtag Strategy

**Primary Hashtag:** #BURNBOOK (short, memorable, unlikely to collide)

**Secondary Hashtags (use 1-2 per post, rotate):**
- #RealityTV
- #IndieGame
- #SimulationGame
- #ManagementSim
- #TheBachelor (when targeting Bachelor fans)
- #BravoTV (when targeting Housewives fans)
- #SteamNextFest (during Next Fest)
- #WishlistWednesday (on Wednesdays, duh)

**Branded Hashtag for UGC:** #BurnbookStories (for players sharing their experiences)

## 8. PRESS OUTREACH STRATEGY

### 8.1 Two-Pronged Approach

**Games Press:**

Standard pitch. Focus on mechanics, AI simulation, ethical design, management sim depth.

**Target Outlets (Tier 1):**
- Polygon
- Kotaku
- PC Gamer
- Rock Paper Shotgun
- Eurogamer
- IGN (reach is huge, even if prestige is lower)

**Pitch Angle for Games Press:**
"BURNBOOK is a reality TV production simulator with AI-driven cast members who form real relationships, have real breakdowns, and remember everything you did to them. It's *Papers, Please* meets *The Bachelor* — a management sim where the core mechanic is moral compromise. We're offering early access for preview coverage."

**Entertainment/Culture Press:**

Non-standard pitch. Focus on reality TV critique, ethical themes, cultural commentary.

**Target Outlets (Tier 1):**
- Vulture (New York Magazine's entertainment vertical)
- The AV Club
- Paste Magazine
- Slate (culture section)
- The Verge (they cover games, but frame this as a cultural artifact)
- Vox (Explainer angle: "How reality TV actually works, as explained by a video game")

**Pitch Angle for Entertainment Press:**
"We made a video game that's a playable critique of reality TV. It simulates the full production pipeline — casting, drama engineering, editing — and forces players to confront the ethics of making content from human vulnerability. It's what *UnREAL* would be if *UnREAL* was interactive. We think your readers who love/hate reality TV would find this fascinating."

### 8.2 Press Kit Contents

**Digital Press Kit (hosted on website, linked in all outreach):**

- **Fact Sheet:** Game title, developer, release date, platforms, price, website, social links, contact email
- **Description:** One-paragraph hook + long description
- **Key Features:** Bulleted list (AI-driven cast, burn book, edit bay, etc.)
- **Trailer:** Embedded YouTube link (announcement trailer, launch trailer)
- **Screenshots:** 10-15 high-res screenshots (1920x1080 PNG)
  - Production suite
  - Burn book (dossier page)
  - Scene planner
  - Edit bay (timeline view)
  - Ratings report
  - Confessional footage
  - Dramatic scene moments
- **Logos & Key Art:** PNG and vector formats, various sizes
- **Developer Bios:** 2-3 sentences on key team members (or studio, if applicable)
- **Comparable Games:** "If you liked X, you'll love BURNBOOK" section
- **Contact:** Email and Discord for press inquiries
- **Review Key Request Form:** Google Form for outlets to request Steam keys

**Physical Press Kit (Optional, for major outlets/events):**

A manila folder (burn book aesthetic) containing:
- Printed fact sheet
- USB drive with trailer, screenshots, logos
- Handwritten note: "We made a game about reality TV. We think you'll find it interesting. — The Team"
- A pack of Post-it notes (cheeky: "For your own burn book")

Send to 5-10 top-tier outlets (Polygon, Kotaku, Vulture, AV Club, etc.) 1 month before launch.

### 8.3 Pitch Email Template (Games Press)

**Subject:** BURNBOOK — Reality TV production sim with AI cast (Preview Access Available)

**Body:**

> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm reaching out because we're developing BURNBOOK, a reality TV production simulator that I think [Outlet] readers would find compelling.
>
> **The pitch:** You cast reality shows with AI-driven personalities who form genuine relationships, fall into real love, and have actual psychological breakdowns. You engineer drama by exploiting their trauma (you have a dossier on everyone's deepest insecurities). Then you control the edit — choosing which moments air, which music cues reframe them, which cuts make someone a hero or a villain. The cast remembers everything you did. The ratings reward exploitation. The game never tells you to stop.
>
> It's *The Sims* meets *Nightcrawler*, mechanically inspired by *Papers, Please* and *RimWorld*, thematically wrestling with the ethics of reality television.
>
> **Why now:** We're announcing [this month / appearing at Steam Next Fest / launching on X date]. I'd love to offer you early access for preview coverage, or I'm happy to set up an interview with the design team to discuss the ethics of simulating exploitation.
>
> Press kit: [link]
> Announcement trailer: [link]
> Steam page: [link]
>
> Let me know if this sounds interesting. Thanks for your time.
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]
> [Title], BURNBOOK
> [Email] | [Twitter]

### 8.4 Pitch Email Template (Entertainment Press)

**Subject:** We made a video game about the ethics of reality TV

**Body:**

> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm writing because we've built something unusual: a video game that's essentially a playable version of *UnREAL*.
>
> BURNBOOK is a reality TV production simulator. You cast shows, manipulate contestants (they're AI-driven, with real psychology and breaking points), and edit the footage to control what the audience sees. The game doesn't moralize — it just makes you do the job of a reality TV producer and shows you the consequences: stress meters climbing, legal threats, tabloid headlines, former cast members still carrying the damage years later.
>
> It's designed for people who love and/or hate reality TV — people who watch *The Bachelor* while tweeting about producer manipulation, who listen to reality TV recap podcasts, who've read the think pieces about the ethics of the genre. It's a game that takes reality TV seriously as a subject, not just as a gag.
>
> I think [Outlet]'s readers would find this fascinating, especially given your coverage of [reference a specific article they've written about reality TV or media ethics]. Would you be interested in coverage? I can offer early access, developer interviews, or whatever format works for you.
>
> Press kit: [link]
> Announcement trailer: [link]
>
> Thanks for considering.

> Best,
> [Your Name]

## 9. INFLUENCER & STREAMER STRATEGY

### 9.1 Target Influencer Types

**Tier 1: Management Sim Specialists**

YouTubers/streamers who cover *Two Point Hospital*, *Planet Zoo*, *Game Dev Tycoon*, *Prison Architect*. They have audiences who love deep systems and long play sessions.

**Examples:** Blitz, Pravus Gaming, Splattercat, Wanderbots

**Approach:** Standard key send. Email: "We're making a reality TV management sim with AI cast members and an edit bay. We think your audience would love the systems depth. Here's a key. No obligations."

**Tier 2: Narrative/Indie Game Curators**

Influencers who cover story-rich indie games, experimental mechanics, ethical design. They appreciate *Papers, Please*, *Return of the Obra Dinn*, *Disco Elysium*.

**Examples:** NorthernLion, Wertpol, MandaloreGaming, Noah Caldwell-Gervais (if he'd cover it)

**Approach:** Emphasize the thematic depth. "This game is about the ethics of reality TV, explored through gameplay. It's mechanically a management sim, but emotionally it's something else."

**Tier 3: Reality TV Crossover Personalities**

YouTubers or podcasters who cover reality TV but might be interested in a game about it. This is unconventional but high-reward if they bite.

**Examples:** Reality TV recap podcasters (*Watch What Crappens*, *Rose Pricks*), YouTube essayists who analyze reality TV

**Approach:** "We made a game about the thing you cover. It's not a shallow tie-in — it's a simulation of production. We'd love to send you a key and see what you think."

### 9.2 Influencer Outreach Cadence

**Phase 1 (Announcement):**
Send keys to 10-15 Tier 1 influencers. Goal: Get 2-3 videos in the first month post-announcement.

**Phase 2 (Next Fest Demo):**
Send demo keys to 50+ influencers across all tiers. No pressure, just "the demo is available, we think you'd enjoy it."

**Phase 3 (Launch):**
Send full game keys to 200+ influencers. Cast a wide net. Encourage launch-day streams ("We'd love to see your first season").

**Post-Launch:**
Ongoing outreach. Monthly check-ins with top influencers. Offer DLC keys, exclusive interviews, early access to updates.

### 9.3 Influencer Support

**What We Provide:**
- Steam keys (obviously)
- Press kit access (trailers, screenshots, logos for thumbnails)
- Discord access (so they can ask questions, report bugs, interact with community)
- Promotional support (retweet their videos, feature them in devlogs: "Streamer X had a wild season, check it out")

**What We Don't Do:**
- Sponsored content (too expensive, feels inauthentic)
- Mandatory coverage clauses (breeds resentment)
- Review manipulation ("please say nice things")

Influencers cover the game because it's interesting, not because we paid them. Authentic enthusiasm > paid promotion.

## 10. COMMUNITY BUILDING STRATEGY

### 10.1 Community Pillars

A healthy game community is built on three pillars: **Identity, Events, and Ownership**.

**Identity:**
Players need to feel like being part of the BURNBOOK community says something about them. They're not just "people who play a game" — they're people who understand reality TV, who appreciate complex systems, who can handle moral ambiguity in their entertainment. The community identity is: smart, media-literate, ethically aware, slightly complicit.

**Events:**
Regular, scheduled activities that give people a reason to return. Watch parties, design challenges, Discord events, seasonal competitions.

**Ownership:**
Opportunities for the community to shape the game or the culture around it. Fan art, cast member design contests, wiki building, mod support (if feasible).

### 10.2 Discord Community Management

**Roles & Permissions:**

- **@Showrunner** (devs, community managers): Full permissions, distinguished color
- **@Producer** (active contributors, beta testers): Elevated permissions (embed links, etc.)
- **@Cast Member** (everyone else): Standard permissions

**Channel Structure (Expanded from Section 7.1):**

- **#announcements** (dev posts only)
- **#general** (open chat)
- **#reality-tv-fans** (off-topic: discuss real reality TV)
- **#game-discussion** (strategy, questions, experiences)
- **#burn-book-showcase** (share cast profiles, dramatic moments, screenshots)
- **#feedback** (structured feedback for devs)
- **#fan-creations** (art, videos, memes, fiction)
- **#bug-reports** (technical issues)
- **#spoilers** (late-game discussion, clearly marked)
- **#voice-chat** (for events, watch parties)

**Moderation Philosophy:**

Light touch. The community is adults discussing a game about ethical complexity. Allow robust discussion, even criticism of the game. Intervene only for: harassment, doxxing, spam, illegal content.

**Community Manager Role:**

If budget allows, hire a part-time CM (10-20 hrs/week) post-launch. Responsibilities:
- Daily Discord presence (answer questions, moderate, spark discussion)
- Social media engagement (reply to tweets, share fan content)
- Weekly community recap (newsletter or Discord post: "This week in BURNBOOK")
- Event organization (watch parties, contests)

If budget doesn't allow, the dev team shares CM duties. It's not optional — community management is part of the job.

### 10.3 Community Events (Monthly Schedule)

**Week 1:** Watch Party Wednesday
- Stream a classic reality TV episode (The Real World, early Survivor, Bachelor)
- Devs and community watch together via Discord screen share or Twitch
- Discuss producer choices, manipulation tactics, editing decisions
- Connect it to the game: "How would you recreate this moment in BURNBOOK?"

**Week 2:** Design Challenge
- Rotating challenges:
  - Month 1: "Design a Cast Member" (submit personality profile, archetype, backstory)
  - Month 2: "Design a Show Format" (pitch a new reality show format for the game)
  - Month 3: "Design a Catalyst" (invent a new drama-engineering tool)
  - Month 4: Repeat
- Winners get featured in devlog, possibly implemented in game

**Week 3:** Strategy Discussion
- Topic-driven discussion threads:
  - "What's the most ethical way to produce a season?"
  - "How do you balance ratings and cast sustainability?"
  - "What's your highest/lowest rating ever?"
- Devs participate, share insights from playtesting

**Week 4:** Showcase Saturday
- Community members share their best/worst/funniest moments
- Screenshots of burn book pages, ratings reports, tabloid headlines
- Voting for "Moment of the Month" (winner gets featured on social media)

### 10.4 Long-Term Community Goals

**Year 1:**
- 2,000+ Discord members
- Active daily discussions (50+ messages/day in #general)
- 10+ fan creations per month (art, videos, memes)
- 1-2 community-designed elements added to the game

**Year 2:**
- 5,000+ Discord members
- Wiki maintained by community (cast archetypes, strategies, format guides)
- Modding support (if technically feasible — allow custom cast, formats, music cues)
- Annual community event: "The Burnies" (awards for best community content, voted by community)

## 11. TRAILER SCRIPT (ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER)

**BURNBOOK — Announcement Trailer**
**Runtime:** 90 seconds
**Format:** Fake behind-the-scenes documentary style

---

**[0:00-0:05]**
*Black screen. The sound of a tape deck clicking on. Ambient office noise fades in.*

**[0:05-0:15]**
*Handheld camera footage, grainy. A production office. Monitors glow in the background. A producer (voice only, off-screen):*

> "Okay, so we're making a game about reality TV. But here's the thing — we can make her the villain or the victim. It depends on the edit."

*Cut to: Footage on a monitor. A woman crying in a confessional booth. Close-up on her face.*

**[0:15-0:30]**
*Cut to: The edit bay interface. Clean, professional, dark blue UI. A timeline with 6 segment slots. A hand (cursor) drags a footage clip into Segment 3. The thumbnail shows the crying woman.*

*The hand hovers over a dropdown labeled "MUSIC CUE." Selects: "SINISTER STING."*

*The monitor plays the moment again. Same footage. But now, with the sinister music cue, her tears feel calculated. Manipulative. Villainous.*

*Text overlay on screen:*

**THE EDIT IS WHERE YOU DECIDE WHAT'S REAL.**

**[0:30-0:50]**
*Quick cuts, montage style. Each shot 1-2 seconds:*

1. **Burn book page flipping.** Handwritten notes, psychological profile, a photo of a cast member paper-clipped to the corner. Text: "Jade Morrison — The Sweetheart — Wound: Abandoned by mother at age 16."
2. **Scene planner interface.** Top-down view of a dinner table. Cast member portraits dragged into seats.
3. **Multi-camera monitor bank.** Four screens showing the same dinner scene from different angles. Two people shouting. One person crying. One person watching in silence.
4. **Ratings report.** A Nielsen printout landing on a desk. The number "2.7" in gold. Handwritten note in margin: "Good work. Keep it up."
5. **Tabloid headline.** Newspaper clipping: "FORMER CAST MEMBER: 'THEY DESTROYED ME FOR RATINGS.'"
6. **Confessional footage.** A man (Marcus) looking directly at the camera, jaw tight: "She made me look like a monster. I wasn't... I wasn't trying to hurt anyone."

**[0:50-1:15]**
*Back to the production office. The producer's voice-over continues:*

> "You cast the show. You engineer the drama. You control the narrative. And the cast? They remember. Every choice. Every edit. Every betrayal."

*Cut to: Burn book page. A red annotation: "WARNED JADE ABOUT MARCUS — SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE ME. PI AT 48%."*

*Cut to: Edit bay. A segment labeled "EPISODE 6 — THE BREAKDOWN." The player hesitates. Cursor hovers over the "BROADCAST" button.*

*Producer voice-over:*

> "The question is: how far will you go for a 2.7 share?"

*Click. The button is pressed. Cut to black.*

**[1:15-1:25]**
*Title card fades in.*

**BURNBOOK**

*Below the title:*

**Reality TV Production Simulator**
**Coming 2027**

*Below that:*

**Wishlist Now on Steam**

**[1:25-1:30]**
*Final shot: The production suite at 3 AM. Monitors glowing. The desk is cluttered with coffee cups, call sheets, Nielsen printouts. The edit bay timeline is paused on a frozen frame: a woman's face, mid-breakdown.*

*Text overlay:*

**They signed the contract. You held the scissors.**

*Fade to black. Audio: A tape deck clicks off.*

## 12. BUDGET SUMMARY (18-MONTH MARKETING PLAN)

| Phase | Duration | Budget | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Phase 1: Pre-Announcement** | Months -18 to -12 | $0 | Internal prototyping, key art, soft influencer outreach |
| **Phase 2: Announcement** | Months -12 to -9 | $5,000 | Announcement trailer, Steam page, press outreach, social media launch |
| **Phase 3: Devlog Era** | Months -9 to -6 | $3,000 | Bi-weekly devlogs, community events, influencer seeding |
| **Phase 4: Next Fest** | Months -6 to -4 | $8,000 | Demo build, Next Fest appearance, press blitz, paid ads |
| **Phase 5: Beta & Launch Prep** | Months -4 to Launch | $15,000 | Closed beta, launch trailer, review campaign, store polish, paid ads |
| **Phase 6: Launch Week** | Launch to Day 7 | $5,000 | Launch livestream, community events, emergency PR, paid ads |
| **Phase 7: Post-Launch** | Months 1-6 | $12,000 ($2K/mo) | Ongoing ads, community management, update trailers |
| **TOTAL** | 18 months | **$48,000** | |

**Budget Notes:**

- This is a lean, indie-scale marketing budget. A AA game would spend 10x this. But BURNBOOK's strength is its premise and community, not its marketing spend.
- The largest line items are: Next Fest ($8K), Beta/Launch Prep ($15K), and Post-Launch ($12K).
- Paid ads are conservative ($10K total across 18 months). Most growth is organic: press, influencers, community word-of-mouth.
- If budget is tighter, cut: paid ads (rely on organic), physical press kits (digital is fine), influencer care packages (keys are free).
- If budget is larger, invest in: professional PR firm ($10-20K), higher-quality trailers ($10K+), more aggressive paid ads ($20K+).

---

## 14. RISK ASSESSMENT & CONTINGENCIES

### 14.1 Risk: The Game Doesn't Resonate

**Scenario:** Announcement trailer drops. Reception is lukewarm. Wishlists trickle in slowly. Press is indifferent.

**Early Warning Signs:**
- <2K wishlists in first week
- <10 press articles in announcement month
- Social media engagement is low (<100 likes/RTs per post)

**Contingency:**
- Pivot messaging. Test alternate hooks. Is it the "reality TV" angle that's not landing? Try emphasizing "AI simulation" or "ethical management sim."
- Invest in paid ads earlier than planned. Boost the announcement trailer on Twitter/YouTube.
- Do a Reddit AMA immediately (not waiting for Next Fest). Generate discussion, gather feedback, iterate.
- Consider a closed alpha for community (100 keys to superfans). Build evangelists early.

### 14.2 Risk: Technical Issues at Launch

**Scenario:** Game launches with critical bugs. Crashes, save corruption, AI behaving nonsensically. Reviews tank.

**Early Warning Signs:**
- Beta testers report major issues
- QA identifies blockers late in development
- Day-one reviews mention the same bug repeatedly

**Contingency:**
- Delay launch. Better to delay 2 weeks and launch clean than launch broken and never recover.
- If launch happens and bugs surface, respond immediately:
  - Acknowledge publicly within 4 hours
  - Hotfix within 24-48 hours
  - Transparent communication: "We're aware of X, we're working on a fix, ETA is Y."
  - Offer refunds proactively for severely affected players
- Steam allows you to weather bad launch reviews IF you fix issues fast and communicate well. *No Man's Sky* recovered. *Cyberpunk 2077* is recovering. Transparency + rapid action = second chances.

### 14.3 Risk: Community Backlash (Ethical Concerns)

**Scenario:** Some players or press criticize the game as "exploitative" or "glorifying psychological abuse." Social media backlash. Think pieces accusing the game of being harmful.

**Early Warning Signs:**
- Heated discussions in Discord/Reddit about whether the game is "too dark"
- Press articles with headlines like "Is This Game Ethical?"
- Twitter discourse: "This game is gross"

**Contingency:**
- **Do not get defensive.** The game is intentionally about ethical complexity. Acknowledge the critique.
- **Amplify the design intent:** "BURNBOOK doesn't glorify exploitation — it makes you feel the weight of it. The discomfort is the point. If the game makes you feel complicit, it's working."
- **Lean into the conversation:** Do interviews about the ethics of game design. Write an op-ed: "Why We Made a Game About Reality TV's Dark Side."
- **Listen for legitimate concerns:** If players feel the game is punching down or trivializing real trauma, take that seriously. Adjust tone in updates if needed.
- **Trust the audience:** The game's target audience is media-literate adults who can handle moral complexity. Don't water it down to appease bad-faith critics.

### 14.4 Risk: Reality TV IP Lawsuit

**Scenario:** A network or production company claims the game infringes on their IP (show format, branding, etc.).

**Early Warning Signs:**
- Cease-and-desist letter arrives
- Legal threats via social media or press

**Contingency:**
- **Preemptive protection:** Use parody formats, not real show names. "House of Strangers" not "The Real World." "Heartshot" not "The Bachelor." Parody is protected under fair use.
- **Consult a lawyer immediately.** Do not respond to legal threats without legal counsel.
- **Be prepared to rename/reskin:** If a format name is too close, change it. The mechanics are what matter, not the branding.
- **Lean on community:** If a big network tries to bully a small indie game, the internet will side with you. But only if you're actually in the right (i.e., you're not stealing their IP).

### 14.5 Risk: Market Saturation / Competitor Emerges

**Scenario:** Another developer announces a similar game (reality TV sim, AI-driven cast, etc.) and beats you to market.

**Early Warning Signs:**
- Competitor game announced with similar premise
- Press compares your game unfavorably to competitor

**Contingency:**
- **Differentiate aggressively:** Highlight what BURNBOOK does that the competitor doesn't. The edit bay? The burn book? The moral weight? Find your unique angle and hammer it.
- **Accelerate timeline if possible** (but don't sacrifice quality). First-mover advantage is real.
- **Collaborate, don't compete:** If the competitor is an indie too, consider cross-promotion. "If you like their game, you'll like ours." Rising tide lifts all boats.
- **Stay confident:** BURNBOOK's design is strong. The premise is deep. If a competitor exists, it validates the market. There's room for more than one game in a genre.

## 15. POST-LAUNCH CONTENT ROADMAP (MARKETING ANGLE)

Post-launch content isn't just for retention — it's a marketing tool. Every update is a PR opportunity.

### 15.1 Month 1: Patch 1.1 (QoL Update)

**Content:**
- Bug fixes
- Balance tweaks (based on player feedback: cast stress decay, burn book confidence rates, etc.)
- UI improvements (faster timeline scrubbing, better burn book search, etc.)

**Marketing Angle:**
"We're listening. Patch 1.1 is live with community-requested improvements."

**Assets:**
- Patch notes (detailed, transparent)
- Social media post: "Thank you for the feedback. Here's what we fixed."
- No trailer needed (it's a patch, not new content)

**Press Outreach:** None (too small for press coverage)

### 15.2 Month 2: New Format — "Runway War"

**Content:**
- New show format based on *America's Next Top Model*
- Competitive challenges (photoshoots, runway walks)
- Panel elimination format
- New cast archetypes specific to the format

**Marketing Angle:**
"Free content update: Model competition format now available. Vogue meets psychological warfare."

**Assets:**
- Trailer (30 seconds: show the new format, elimination panel, cast reactions)
- Screenshots of the new format in action
- Devlog: "How we designed Runway War"

**Press Outreach:** Send to outlets that covered the game at launch. Pitch: "Free update adds new reality show format." Target: 10-20 articles.

**Social Media:** GIFs of dramatic eliminations, panel confrontations. Hashtag: #RunwayWar

### 15.3 Month 3: Community Event — "Design a Cast Member"

**Content:**
- Contest: Players submit cast member designs (personality profile, backstory, archetype)
- Devs pick top 10, add them to the procedural generation pool (with credit to creators)
- Winning designs featured in a devlog

**Marketing Angle:**
"Your cast member could be in the game. Submit your design."

**Assets:**
- Contest announcement (blog post, social media)
- Submission form (Google Form)
- Winner announcement (devlog + social media)

**Press Outreach:** None (community-focused, not press-worthy)

**Social Media:** Feature submissions throughout the month. Build hype.

### 15.4 Month 4: Major Update — "The Reunion Special"

**Content:**
- End-of-season reunion episode (stretch goal feature)
- Former cast members return, watch clips, confront each other
- New gameplay: managing the reunion as a live event, handling cast confrontations in real-time

**Marketing Angle:**
"The Reunion Special is here. Your cast members remember everything. And they're not happy."

**Assets:**
- Trailer (60 seconds: tease the reunion format, show cast confrontations, raise tension)
- Screenshots of the reunion interface
- Devlog: "Designing the Reunion Special — The Reckoning Mechanic"

**Press Outreach:** Major update = major press push. Target: 30-50 articles. Pitch: "BURNBOOK's biggest update adds accountability mechanic — former cast members confront the player's choices."

**Social Media:** Build hype for 2 weeks before release. "The reunion is coming. Are you ready?"

### 15.5 Month 6: Evaluation Point

**Assess:**
- Sales performance (are we at 50K? 30K? 10K?)
- Community health (is Discord still active? Are people still playing?)
- Development capacity (do we have the team/budget for DLC or a sequel?)

**Options:**

1. **If sales are strong (50K+):** Develop paid DLC or expansion. New formats, new features (rival showrunner, format lab, etc.). Price: $10-15. Continue supporting the game for another 12 months.

2. **If sales are modest (20-30K):** Focus on free updates for another 6 months to build goodwill and long-tail sales. No paid DLC (community too small to justify). Start prototyping a sequel with lessons learned.

3. **If sales are weak (<10K):** Wind down active development. Release one final "thank you" update with community-requested features. Shift focus to next project. BURNBOOK becomes a portfolio piece and a learning experience.

**Marketing Angle (for any scenario):**
Transparency. Tell the community what's next, honestly. Indie devs who communicate openly build loyalty that lasts beyond one game.

## 17. CLOSING STATEMENT FROM HYPE

I've built marketing plans for games that had everything — budget, talent, polish — and failed because they waited too long to start. I've seen games with nothing — no budget, no name, no safety net — succeed because they built a community from day one and never stopped talking to them.

BURNBOOK has the premise. It has the mechanics. It has the cultural moment (reality TV is bigger than ever, and the discourse around its ethics is louder than ever). What it needs is a marketing strategy that starts now and never stops.

This isn't a hype cycle. This isn't a press release three weeks before launch. This is an 18-month conversation with the audience, starting the day the prototype works and ending... never. Post-launch isn't the end of marketing. It's the beginning of the long tail.

The audience for this game exists. They're on Reddit dissecting Bachelor episodes. They're on Twitter roasting Housewives producers. They're playing management sims and wishing the theme was more interesting. They're waiting for a game that respects their intelligence and their love of messy, complicated, morally fraught entertainment.

BURNBOOK is that game. The marketing plan is how we make sure they know it exists.

Start building the audience NOW. The Steam page goes live the moment we have a GIF of the edit bay. The Discord opens the day we announce. The devlog begins before the first prototype. We're not selling a product. We're inviting people into a conversation about reality TV, ethics, and the cost of making content from human lives.

They'll come. They'll wishlist. They'll argue in Discord. They'll play the demo. They'll buy the game. They'll make fan art. They'll design cast members. They'll stream their chaotic seasons. They'll write think pieces. They'll argue about whether the game is ethical. And all of it — all of it — is marketing.

Because the best marketing for a game this smart is the community it creates.

Let's build this.

*Marketing plan for BURNBOOK, written by HYPE (Marketing & Community Manager) in collaboration with REED (Game Design), NOVA (Narrative Design), and PIXEL (Art Direction). This document is the roadmap from first commit to 50,000 sales.*

**What's the GIF? A split-screen: raw footage on the left, edited broadcast on the right. Same moment. Different story. That's BURNBOOK. That's the hook. That's the game.**

**Show the GAME, not the features. Start building the audience NOW.**
