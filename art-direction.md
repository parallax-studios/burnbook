## 0. VISUAL IDENTITY STATEMENT

**BURNBOOK is a game about watching. Not experiencing — watching. The player sits in a windowless room surrounded by glowing screens, manipulating lives through layers of mediation. The art direction must reinforce this distance at every turn.**

The visual identity has three core truths:

1. **The Production Suite is a Panopticon** — You see everything. You control everything. The cast is always on-screen, always mediated through camera feeds. You never walk the sets. You never breathe the same air. The camera is the only reality.

2. **2005 is a Wound, Not a Style** — This isn't nostalgia porn. The mid-2000s aesthetic is deliberate: the technological limitations of the era (SD resolution, tape-based workflows, chunky CRT monitors) forced a specific relationship between producer and cast. The fidelity was low enough that you could lie. The edit was manual enough that you felt the cut. The production design evokes institutional spaces — places where human vulnerability becomes processed content.

3. **Beauty is a Trap** — If the game is beautiful, it fails. BURNBOOK should look like work. Fluorescent lighting, stained ceiling tiles, Avid editing bays with grey panels and coffee rings on the desk. The burn book should look like a document that's been handled, not a UI that's been designed. The visual identity is unglamorous because the work is unglamorous. Making content from people is a job, not an art form.

**The visual promise:** A dimly lit editing suite at 3 AM. Multiple monitors glow with surveillance footage. Your hand hovers over the keyboard. In twelve hours, fifty million people will see what you decide tonight. Does this read at a glance? Yes. Does it promise power? Yes. Does it promise comfort? No. Good.

## 1. VISUAL REFERENCES & MOOD BOARD

### 1.1 Primary References

**THE EDIT BAY (Core Aesthetic)**

**Avid Media Composer (2003-2007 interface)**
The grey panels. The timeline tracks color-coded by clip type. The source monitor on the left, program monitor on the right. The nested bins. The precise, utilitarian layout that screams "professional tool, not creative toy." BURNBOOK's edit bay should feel like a slightly simplified Avid interface — recognizable to anyone who's been in a production environment, but not so dense that it's intimidating.

**"The Larry Sanders Show" (1992-1998) — Control Room Aesthetic**
The dimly lit control room with multiple monitors showing simultaneous feeds. The producer sitting in the dark, watching everything, making real-time decisions. The institutional carpet, the office chairs on wheels, the cables taped to the floor. The aesthetic of television production as bureaucracy.

**"Nightcrawler" (2014) — The Surveillance Monitor View**
Jake Gyllenhaal watching footage on a laptop in a parked car at night. The cold blue glow. The detachment. The framing that makes the watcher as interesting as the watched. When the player views scene footage, they should feel like they're watching something they shouldn't see — not because it's forbidden, but because the angle is wrong, the distance is wrong, the mediation is wrong.

**"Zodiac" (2007) — The Obsessive Documentation Aesthetic**
Robert Graysmith's apartment covered in notes, timelines, photos connected by red string. Not beautiful — compulsive. The burn book should evoke this: a dossier that's been annotated, cross-referenced, updated in the margins. The visual language of investigation as obsession.

**"The Conversation" (1974) — The Audio/Video Surveillance Equipment**
Reel-to-reel tape decks, headphones, waveform displays on oscilloscopes. The physicality of recording technology. BURNBOOK's production suite should feel tactile — machines that hum, tape that spools, footage that exists on physical media (even if it's simulated).

**VH1 "Behind the Music" (1997-2006) — The Talking Head Confessional**
The single-camera setup against a neutral backdrop. The subject framed slightly off-center. The lower-third chyron with name and title. The confessional aesthetic that became the visual grammar of reality TV. When cast members speak to the camera in BURNBOOK, this is the reference.

**"UnReal" (2015-2018, the TV show) — Production Office as War Room**
The producers huddled around monitors, making decisions in real-time. The wall of screens showing every camera angle. The call sheets on clipboards, the production notes on whiteboards, the energy drink cans and takeout containers. The production office as a space where human drama is processed into broadcast content.

### 1.2 Secondary References (Shape Language & Composition)

**Edward Hopper (particularly "Office at Night," 1940)**
The isolated figure in an institutional space, lit by cold artificial light. The geometry of alienation: rectangles within rectangles, harsh shadows, the person dwarfed by the architecture of their work.

**Andreas Gursky Photography (particularly "99 Cent II Diptych," 2001)**
The grid. The overwhelming array. The sense of systems too large to comprehend but perfectly organized. The burn book's cast management screen should evoke this: a grid of headshots, data, relationships — human beings as units in a system.

**Blade Runner (1982) — The Voight-Kampff Test Scene**
Deckard watching the monitor, analyzing responses, looking for tells. The clinical detachment. The machinery of interrogation. The confessional booth interface in BURNBOOK should reference this: the cast member on screen, their emotional state displayed as data, the player analyzing them like specimens.

**Papers, Please (2013, the game) — The Document Inspector Interface**
The stamped dossiers, the cross-referencing, the sense of bureaucratic work as moral decision. The burn book should borrow this tactile document aesthetic: paper texture, rubber stamp approvals, highlighted discrepancies, the feeling of shuffling through files.

**Her Story (2015, the game) — The Database Search Interface**
The CRT monitor. The search bar. The grid of video clips. The player piecing together narrative from fragments. BURNBOOK's footage stockpile in the edit bay should echo this: a grid of captured moments, each thumbnail showing a frozen frame, the player searching for the right clip to build the story they want.

### 1.3 Anti-References (What NOT to Look Like)

**The Sims (any version)** — Too bright. Too colorful. Too isometric. Too playful. The Sims lets you see the characters' space from a god's-eye view. BURNBOOK denies you that intimacy. You see them only through cameras.

**Reality TV mobile games (Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, etc.)** — Too glamorous. Too aspirational. These games present reality TV as a path to stardom. BURNBOOK presents it as a path to content. The aesthetic should be institutional, not inspirational.

**The Movies (2005, the game)** — Too whimsical. Too tycoon-game bright. The Movies made filmmaking look fun. BURNBOOK makes television production look like what it is: a job performed in ugly offices by tired people making compromises.

**Big Brother live feeds (actual)** — Too raw. Too real-time. Too unmediated. BURNBOOK's camera feeds should always feel like *production* footage — multiple angles, clean framings, intentional compositions. Not security cameras, but broadcast cameras. The difference matters: security cameras are about surveillance, broadcast cameras are about manufacturing images for public consumption.

## 2. COLOR PALETTE & USAGE RULES

### 2.1 Core Palette (The Production Suite)

**#1a1a2e — "Editing Suite Midnight"**
The deep navy-black of the production suite at night. This is the dominant color — the void behind the monitors. Usage: UI backgrounds, negative space, the darkness that frames all the glowing screens. This color should occupy 40-50% of screen real estate at any given time. The player works in darkness.

**#0f3460 — "Monitor Blue"**
The cold blue glow of CRT monitors and LCD screens. Not quite cyan, not quite navy — the specific blue of a television screen in a dark room. Usage: Monitor bezels, UI panels, any interface element that represents "looking at a screen." Secondary dominant color, 20-25% of screen space.

**#16213e — "Timeline Dark"**
A slightly lighter navy used for the editing timeline, burn book page backgrounds, and nested UI elements. Creates subtle depth without breaking the monochromatic foundation. Usage: Secondary panels, document backgrounds, hover states.

**#c4c4c4 — "Fluorescent Grey"**
The washed-out grey of office spaces under fluorescent lighting. Lifeless, institutional, familiar to anyone who's worked in a corporate environment. Usage: Text, UI labels, call sheets, production documents, any element that represents "paperwork" rather than "screen."

**#e8e8e8 — "Paper White"**
Off-white, slightly aged. Not pure white — that's too clean. This is the white of printed documents, Nielsen reports, burn book pages. Usage: Text-heavy documents, report backgrounds, any interface that simulates physical paper.

### 2.2 Accent Palette (Signal Colors)

**#e94560 — "Recording Light Red"**
The red of a RECORDING indicator light. Hot, urgent, undeniable. This color means "this is happening NOW" or "danger." Usage: REC indicators on camera feeds, urgent alerts, legal risk warnings, stress threshold alerts. Use sparingly — no more than 3-5% of screen space. When the player sees red, it should mean something.

**#f5c518 — "Nielsen Gold"**
The gold of awards, ratings, money. Not quite yellow — richer, more metallic. IMDb yellow. Usage: Ratings numbers, advertiser confidence indicators, budget displays, success metrics. This is the color of "you did it right." Use at 2-3% of screen space, appearing as rewards and key metrics.

**#ff6b6b — "Stress Indicator Coral"**
A softer red, leaning toward coral-pink. This represents human distress — a cast member approaching their breaking point. Usage: PI (Psychological Integrity) meters, cast emotional state warnings, fallout risk indicators. Distinct from hard red (which means production danger) — this means human danger.

**#4ecdc4 — "Confessional Cyan"**
A bright, slightly desaturated cyan. The color of a key light in a confessional booth. Usage: Confessional footage highlights, cast speech bubbles, direct address moments. When a cast member is speaking directly to camera, this color frames them.

**#95e1d3 — "Alliance Green"**
A muted seafoam green. Represents positive relationships, alliances, cooperation. Usage: Relationship map connection lines (positive), cooperation indicators, cast members who are stable and producing good content. A rare color in this game — when you see green, treasure it.

### 2.3 Contextual Palette (Scene-Specific)

**The Raw Footage (Scene Monitors):**
Footage shown on production monitors should have a slightly degraded color profile — slightly oversaturated, slightly contrast-boosted, with a subtle scan-line texture. Think DVD-era reality TV: colors are punchy but not quite realistic. Skin tones lean orange (over-tanned). Shadows are crushed. This isn't cinema; this is broadcast television shot on prosumer cameras in 2005.

**The Broadcast Episode (Final Output):**
When the player watches their assembled episode "as aired," the color grade shifts slightly: a thin vignette, slightly lifted blacks (to simulate compression artifacts), a subtle "TV screen" glow effect. The player should feel the difference between "raw footage" and "broadcast television."

**The Burn Book Pages:**
Aged paper texture. Slightly yellowed (#f5f3ed). Ink is not pure black but a dark blue-grey (#2d3436). Highlights are done in physical yellow highlighter (#fff580), complete with translucent texture. Handwritten notes use a blue ballpoint pen color (#1e3a8a). The burn book should look like a document that exists in the world, not a UI screen.

### 2.4 Color Usage Rules

**Rule 1: The 60-30-10 Law**
At any given screen, color distribution should be approximately:
- 60%: Dark blues and blacks (the void, the production suite)
- 30%: Greys and off-whites (documents, text, UI elements)
- 10%: Accent colors (red, gold, coral, cyan, green)

**Rule 2: Saturation Hierarchy**
The production suite (player's space) is desaturated. The footage (cast members' space) is oversaturated. This creates visual hierarchy: the player exists in a muted, professional space; the cast exists in a heightened, televisual space. The player works. The cast performs.

**Rule 3: Red is Expensive**
The recording-light red (#e94560) should never be used for decoration. Every instance of red on screen must mean something: a camera is recording, a risk is present, an alert requires attention. If red appears and the player can ignore it, the color budget is broken.

**Rule 4: No Gradients (with exceptions)**
The UI is flat. No glossy buttons, no depth effects, no skeuomorphic shine. The only gradients allowed are:
- Subtle vignettes on broadcast footage
- The glow around active monitors
- The fade on timeline tracks to indicate clip boundaries
Gradients are a visual lie. This game is about lies, but its interface should be honest.

**Rule 5: Text is Always Readable**
Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for all body text. Fluorescent grey (#c4c4c4) on editing suite midnight (#1a1a2e) passes. White (#e8e8e8) on monitor blue (#0f3460) passes. If a color combination fails the squint test, it doesn't ship.

## 3. SHAPE LANGUAGE GUIDE

### 3.1 Core Principles

**Rectangles Within Rectangles**
The production suite is a grid. Monitors are rectangles. The editing timeline is a rectangle subdivided into clip rectangles. The burn book is a binder holding rectangular pages. UI panels are rectangular. This isn't just efficiency — it's thematic. The player exists in a space designed for processing, sorting, organizing. No organic shapes. No curves. The only curves in the game are human faces on camera feeds, and even those are trapped inside rectangular frames.

**The Aspect Ratio Tells the Truth**
- **4:3 (1.33:1):** CRT monitors, older footage, confessional booth feeds. The boxy, nostalgic aspect ratio of early 2000s television.
- **16:9 (1.78:1):** HD broadcast monitors, the editing timeline, the "modern" production equipment. Wider, more cinematic, but still utilitarian.
- **The Burn Book is 8.5" x 11":** Portrait orientation. The opposite of every screen in the game. The burn book is analog, tangible, paper-based. Its shape should feel wrong in a landscape-dominated interface.

**Hard Edges, Clean Cuts**
No rounded corners except where physically necessary (monitor bezels, because that's how CRTs were built). Buttons are rectangles. Panels snap to grid. The editing timeline has hard cut points, not smooth transitions. The shape language reflects the player's power: you are making cuts, not blends. You are choosing, not averaging.

**Negative Space is Surveillance**
The black space around monitors isn't empty — it's the darkness of the production suite, the void from which the player watches. Negative space should feel intentional, not accidental. The player's eye should always have a clear focal point (a glowing monitor, a highlighted document) surrounded by controlled darkness.

### 3.2 UI Component Shapes

**Monitors (Camera Feeds):**
Slightly thick bezels, like 2005-era LCD panels or CRT screens. A subtle glow around active monitors (2-3px soft white halo at 20% opacity). Inactive monitors are dimmer, their bezels less distinct. The monitor bank (4-6 simultaneous feeds during scene shooting) is arranged in a grid: 2x2 for four feeds, 2x3 for six feeds. No creative arrangements — this is professional equipment in a fixed installation.

**The Editing Timeline:**
Horizontal, spanning the width of the screen. Divided into 6-8 segment slots (depending on episode structure). Each slot is a rectangular container. Clips dragged into slots snap precisely — no freeform placement. Clips have colored borders indicating their type:
- **Blue border:** Scene moment (primary footage)
- **Cyan border:** Confessional clip
- **Gold border:** High-drama moment (DV > 75)
- **Red border:** High-risk moment (legal or ethical flag)

**The Burn Book Pages:**
Portrait orientation, simulating a physical dossier. Each cast member has a multi-page entry. The pages feel like they're in a binder — you can see the subtle shadow of the binder rings on the left edge. Pages have:
- **Header:** Cast member photo (small, polaroid-style) + name + archetype label
- **Body:** Text blocks in a typewriter font, with handwritten annotations in the margins
- **Footer:** Stamped confidence ratings, last-updated date, producer signature (player's "stamp")

The pages look worn. Coffee stains, paper texture, creased corners. Higher-frequency cast members (those you've focused on) have more physical wear. Neglected profiles look pristine — a visual indicator that you're not paying attention.

**Buttons and Controls:**
Rectangular. Minimal. Text-based with a 1px border. Hover state is a subtle background color shift (darker blue for already-blue panels, lighter grey for grey panels). Active state is a thicker border (2px). No shadows, no 3D effects, no skeuomorphism. The buttons look like they belong in a professional tool, not a game.

**Alerts and Popups:**
Rectangular panels that slide in from the edge of the screen (top for urgent alerts, right side for notifications). They don't center-screen interrupt unless the interruption is production-critical (a cast member walking off set, a legal notice, a network emergency call). Respect the player's focus — most alerts are peripheral information, not stop-everything events.

### 3.3 Camera Framing Rules (For Footage Within Monitors)

**Confessional Footage:**
Cast member in a chair, slightly off-center. The camera is at eye level, slightly angled (not directly head-on). Background is neutral but textured (a brick wall, a fabric backdrop, something that reads as "production set" not "sterile void"). Lower-third chyron appears in the bottom 20% of frame: cast member name + a rotating descriptive label (changes based on their current storyline — "The Sweetheart," "Week 4," "After the Fight," etc.).

**Scene Footage:**
Multiple camera angles for the same scene, shown on different monitors:
- **Wide shot:** Establishes the space and all participants
- **Medium two-shot:** Focuses on the two cast members with the most tension
- **Close-up:** Single cast member's face, capturing emotional reactions
- **POV shot:** Over-the-shoulder, creates dramatic irony (we see what they see)

The player can click to cycle through angles on a single monitor, or view all angles simultaneously. The multi-angle view is overwhelming on purpose — the player must choose what to watch, and every choice is a missed opportunity to see something else.

**Broadcast Episode Footage (As-Aired):**
When the player watches their final assembled episode, it's framed within a simulated television screen (16:9 monitor, subtle bezel, slight glow). Lower-third graphics appear: episode title, cast names, dramatic chyrons the player wrote. Music plays. The footage has a subtle "compressed video" look — slightly softer, slightly more artifacted, slightly more saturated. This is what America sees.

## 4. TYPOGRAPHY & TEXT HIERARCHY

### 4.1 Font Stack

**Primary UI Font: "IBM Plex Mono" (or system monospace fallback)**
Monospaced, clean, professional. The font of code editors and production spreadsheets. Usage: All UI labels, buttons, tooltips, system text, timecodes, metadata displays. This is the font of the machine.

**Document Font: "IBM Plex Sans" (or system sans-serif fallback)**
The non-monospace companion to Plex Mono. Slightly warmer, more readable for longer text blocks. Usage: Burn book body text, Nielsen reports, network memos, any text that simulates a printed document.

**Data Font: "Helvetica Neue Bold" (or Arial Bold fallback)**
Clean, authoritative, ubiquitous. The font of broadcast graphics and lower-thirds. Usage: Ratings numbers, cast names in chyrons, episode titles, any text that appears in broadcast context.

**Handwritten Annotations: "Kalam" or "Caveat" (handwriting fonts)**
Used sparingly for margin notes in the burn book, hand-scribbled producer comments, circled numbers, crossed-out text. Should look like someone's actual handwriting, not a decorative script font. Never used for primary information — only annotations and emphasis.

**Typewriter Text: "Courier Prime" (or Courier fallback)**
For the burn book's original typed entries. Monospaced, slightly uneven baseline (to simulate a physical typewriter). Usage: Initial burn book profiles, call sheets, production notes, anything that would have been typed on a typewriter in 2005.

### 4.2 Hierarchy & Scale

**The Type Scale (Base size: 14px at 1080p)**

| Level | Size | Weight | Usage | Example |
|-------|------|--------|-------|---------|
| **Mega** | 48px | Bold | Episode titles, season numbers, major section headers | "EPISODE 4: THE BETRAYAL" |
| **Title** | 32px | Bold | Panel headers, cast member names (in burn book), ratings headlines | "THE BURN BOOK — JADE MORRISON" |
| **Heading** | 24px | Bold | Sub-sections, UI panel labels, confessional timestamps | "Emotional State Analysis" |
| **Subheading** | 18px | Medium | Button labels, timeline segment labels, category headers | "Scene 3: Dinner Confrontation" |
| **Body** | 14px | Regular | Default UI text, burn book body copy, tooltips | "Confidence level: 72% (last updated: Ep 3, Day 2)" |
| **Caption** | 12px | Regular | Metadata, timecodes, footnotes, secondary labels | "Shot on Camera 2, 00:14:32 runtime" |
| **Fine Print** | 10px | Regular | Legal text, version numbers, peripheral info | "Legal risk assessed at 45/100" |

**Line Height:** 1.5x for body text, 1.2x for headings. Monospace text can go tighter (1.3x) because of its inherent spacing.

**Tracking (Letter Spacing):**
- Tight tracking (-0.02em) for large headings — creates density and weight
- Normal tracking (0em) for body text — maximize readability
- Loose tracking (+0.05em) for all-caps labels — prevents crowding

**Text Color Contrast:**
- Primary text: #e8e8e8 (paper white) on #1a1a2e (editing suite midnight) — High contrast, easy to read for hours
- Secondary text: #c4c4c4 (fluorescent grey) on #0f3460 (monitor blue) — Medium contrast, recedes slightly
- Tertiary text: #95a5a6 (muted grey) on #16213e (timeline dark) — Low contrast, for metadata and non-critical info
- Alert text: #e94560 (recording light red) on #1a1a2e — Maximum contrast, demands attention

### 4.3 Text Treatment Rules

**All-Caps for Labels, Title Case for Content**
UI labels are set in ALL CAPS with loose tracking. Cast names, episode titles, burn book headers use Title Case. Body text is sentence case. This creates hierarchy without relying on size or color.

**Monospace for Data, Proportional for Prose**
Anything numerical or code-like (timecodes, ratings, PI percentages, confidence levels) uses monospace. Anything narrative or human-readable (burn book descriptions, network memos, cast dialogue) uses proportional sans-serif.

**No Faux Bold or Faux Italic**
Only use actual bold and italic font weights. Synthetic bolding looks cheap and breaks the professional aesthetic.

**Hyphenation Off, Justification Left**
Body text is always left-aligned, never justified. No hyphenation. Ragged right edge is fine — it's more readable and feels less "designed." The only exception is the burn book, where typewriter text can be justified to simulate a typed document.

**Text Never Touches Edges**
Minimum padding: 16px on all sides of any text container. Text crammed against panel edges looks amateur. Give it room to breathe.

## 5. ANIMATION & MOTION PRINCIPLES

### 5.1 Core Motion Philosophy

**Functional, Not Decorative**
Animation exists to communicate state change, direct attention, or provide feedback. Never animate for style. If removing an animation makes the interface harder to use, keep it. If removing it makes no functional difference, cut it.

**The Speed of Bureaucracy**
This is a game about work. Animations should feel measured, not snappy. UI panels slide in at 200-300ms, not 100ms. Documents shuffle at a pace you can follow. The edit bay timeline scrolls smoothly but not instantly. The player should feel the *process* of their actions, not the instant gratification.

**Physical Metaphors Where Appropriate**
The burn book pages turn. Footage clips snap into timeline slots with a subtle magnetic pull. Monitors power on with a brief flicker. These micro-interactions ground the interface in physicality — you're not just clicking buttons, you're operating equipment and handling documents.

### 5.2 Key Animations

**Monitor Power-On:**
When a camera feed activates (start of a scene), the monitor flickers once (one frame of static), then fades up from black over 0.3 seconds. A subtle CRT screen distortion at the moment of power-on (horizontal scan line shimmer). Accompanied by a soft electronic hum sound.

**Burn Book Page Turn:**
When navigating between cast member profiles, the page curls from the right edge and flips over. Not a 3D page-flip effect (too game-y) — a simple 2D wipe with a subtle curl shadow. Duration: 0.4 seconds. Accompanied by a paper rustle sound.

**Timeline Clip Snap:**
When dragging a footage clip into the timeline, it "snaps" into the segment slot with a subtle magnetic pull (easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)). The clip expands slightly on hover (1.05x scale), shrinks slightly on drag (0.95x scale), then returns to 1.0x on drop. A satisfying *click* sound on snap.

**Alert Slide-In:**
Alerts enter from off-screen with a smooth slide (easing: ease-out, 250ms). They pause for 3-5 seconds (depending on urgency), then slide back out if not interacted with. Low-priority notifications can be dismissed with a quick X button; high-priority alerts require acknowledgment (click to close).

**Stress Meter Fill:**
Cast members' PI (Psychological Integrity) meters deplete gradually over episodes. The fill animates smoothly (not in stepped increments) with a subtle pulse when crossing threshold boundaries (80→79, 60→59, etc.). The meter color shifts gradually as it depletes: green → yellow → coral → red.

**Ratings Reveal:**
When the Nielsen report arrives post-broadcast, the rating number animates in: starts at 0.0, counts up to the actual value over 1.5 seconds (easing: ease-out), accompanied by a mechanical counter sound. Audience segment breakdowns appear sequentially (each segment's bar fills one after the other, 200ms stagger). The full report takes 4-5 seconds to fully resolve — building anticipation.

**Scene Drama Spike:**
During a scene, when a high-drama moment occurs (DV > 65), the relevant monitor's border flashes briefly (recording light red, 0.2s fade-in, hold for 0.5s, 0.3s fade-out) and a small "SPIKE" indicator pops above the monitor with the DV value. The indicator bounces slightly on entry (scale from 0.8 to 1.1 to 1.0 over 0.3s).

### 5.3 Motion Timing

**Instant (0ms):** Hover states on small buttons, tooltip appearances on static elements
**Fast (100-150ms):** Button press feedback, small UI toggles, selection highlights
**Standard (200-300ms):** Panel transitions, page turns, most UI animations
**Deliberate (400-500ms):** Large panel slides, multi-step animations, loading states
**Slow (600ms+):** Cinematic moments (episode title reveal), ratings countup, anything that builds anticipation

**Easing Curves:**
- **Ease-out** (default): Starts fast, ends slow. Use for entrances and reveals. Most common easing.
- **Ease-in-out:** Starts slow, fast in middle, ends slow. Use for continuous motion (scrolling, panning).
- **Cubic-bezier (custom):** For specific effects like the magnetic snap (0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1) or bounce (0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55).

**Frame Rate:**
All animations run at native frame rate (60fps on most displays). No intentional frame rate reduction for "style" — the degraded footage aesthetic is achieved through texture and color grading, not choppy animation.

### 5.4 Camera Movement (Within Footage)

**The footage itself should feel handheld but professional.**

- **Confessionals:** Locked-off camera. No movement. Static frame. The only motion is the cast member shifting in their seat.
- **Scene coverage:** Subtle handheld sway (1-2px random drift at 0.5-1Hz). Not shaky-cam — just enough to feel like a camera operator is holding the camera, not a tripod. This is broadcast television, not found footage.
- **Zoom during dramatic moments:** Very slow, almost imperceptible push-in on a cast member's face during a high-emotion moment. Increases tension. Duration: 3-5 seconds for a 10% zoom.
- **No whip pans, no crash zooms:** This isn't a documentary. This is a multicam reality show. Movements are measured and professional.

## 6. UI/UX DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS

### 6.1 Core Interface: The Production Suite (Home Screen)

**Layout:**
The production suite is the player's hub. It's a single screen that represents their office/edit bay. The layout is persistent across sessions — the player returns to the same space.

**Components:**

1. **Monitor Bank (Center-Top, 60% width, 40% height):**
   4-6 monitors arranged in a grid. During scene shooting, these show live camera feeds. Between scenes, they show idle static or the most recent captured footage (frozen frames). The active monitor has a subtle white glow; inactive ones are dimmer. Click a monitor to focus it (enlarges it slightly and brings its audio to the front).

2. **Editing Timeline (Center-Bottom, 90% width, 20% height):**
   Appears during the edit bay phase. A horizontal strip divided into 6-8 segment slots. Below the timeline is the footage stockpile — a scrollable horizontal row of thumbnail clips the player can drag into segments. Clips show a frozen frame from the moment, a DV number, and a duration indicator.

3. **Burn Book (Left Panel, 25% width, 80% height):**
   Always accessible via a tab on the left edge of the screen. Slides in when clicked, overlaying the monitor bank. The burn book shows the cast roster (headshots + names) and allows the player to dive into individual dossiers. Active cast (still on the show) are at the top; eliminated cast are at the bottom, slightly greyed out.

4. **Ratings & Reports (Right Panel, 25% width, 80% height):**
   Slides in from the right when clicked. Shows the most recent Nielsen report, audience sentiment feed (scrolling social media text), advertiser confidence index, and network notes. Updated after each broadcast.

5. **Production Desk (Bottom, 100% width, 10% height):**
   A persistent footer that represents the player's desk. Contains key info at a glance:
   - Current episode number / Total episodes this season
   - Production budget remaining
   - Next scheduled scene (with timer if time-sensitive)
   - Quick access to: Scene Planner, Cast Management, Format Settings

The desk also accumulates clutter as the season progresses: coffee cups, call sheets, post-it notes with reminders. Cleared at the start of each new season.

6. **Alert Feed (Top-Right, 20% width, floating):**
   A small semi-transparent panel that shows recent alerts: cast member stress warnings, legal notices, tabloid stories, network calls. Alerts stack vertically and auto-dismiss after 5 seconds unless flagged as urgent (red border = requires interaction).

**Interaction Flow:**
The production suite is a hub the player returns to between loops. After shooting a scene, they return to this view. After editing an episode, they return here to see the ratings. After casting a new season, they return to this space — now with a new set of headshots in the burn book. The space should feel like *their* space, accumulating history and weight over time.

### 6.2 The Scene Planner Interface

**Layout:**
Accessed from the production desk. A full-screen overlay that replaces the monitor bank view.

**Left Panel (30% width): Cast Selection**
A vertical list of available cast members. Each entry shows:
- Headshot thumbnail
- Name
- Current emotional state (color-coded: green = stable, yellow = stressed, coral = fragile, red = breaking)
- Current location (if already assigned to a scene this cycle)
- A small "info" icon that pops the burn book summary on hover

Drag cast members from this list into the scene setup area.

**Center Panel (50% width): Scene Setup**
A schematic view of the chosen location (top-down or elevation view, simplified). The location has defined "positions" (seats at a dinner table, lounge chairs around a pool, beds in a shared bedroom). Drag cast member portraits into positions. Empty positions are shown as grey circles.

Below the schematic: Catalyst selection. A horizontal row of available catalysts (shown as icons: envelope for letter, phone for call, champagne bottle for alcohol, question mark for surprise guest). Click to add to the scene. Each catalyst shows its cost and predicted drama boost.

**Right Panel (20% width): Scene Prediction**
Real-time scene analysis based on current setup:
- **Predicted Drama Value:** 0-100, updates as you add/remove cast and catalysts
- **Risk Assessment:** Low / Medium / High / Critical (based on cast stress levels and catalyst choices)
- **Burn Book Insights:** 2-3 bullet points flagging likely interactions ("Marcus and Jade have unresolved tension — expect confrontation" or "Tanya is Jade's only ally — separation may trigger stress event")

At the bottom: A big green "ROLL CAMERAS" button.

**Interaction Feel:**
This interface should feel like a coach drawing up a play on a whiteboard. You're arranging pieces, predicting outcomes, setting the conditions for drama. The scene prediction updates in real-time, giving feedback on every choice. When you click "ROLL CAMERAS," the interface fades out and the monitor bank fades in — the scene begins.

### 6.3 The Edit Bay Interface

**Layout:**
Full-screen, replaces the production suite view. This is where the player spends 8-12 minutes assembling an episode.

**Top Section (80% height): Timeline View**
The editing timeline spans the full width of the screen. 6-8 vertical segment slots, each labeled (Segment 1, Segment 2, etc.). Above the timeline: a scrubber bar showing the episode runtime (segments marked with tick marks).

Each segment slot is a rectangular container. Drag footage clips from the stockpile (below) into slots. Once a clip is in a slot, it displays:
- A thumbnail frame
- The clip's duration
- The DV (drama value)
- Icons indicating: confessional overlay (if added), music cue (if added), chyron (if added)

Click a filled segment to open its detail view (right sidebar).

**Middle Section (20% height): Footage Stockpile**
A scrollable horizontal row of all captured footage from this episode's scenes. Each clip is represented as a thumbnail showing a frozen frame from the moment. Hovering over a clip reveals metadata:
- Scene source (e.g., "Scene 3: Dinner Table")
- DV (drama value)
- Emotional authenticity score
- Legal risk level
- Cast members featured

Clips can be filtered by cast member, scene, DV range, or risk level. The stockpile accumulates across all scenes shot for the episode — by the edit phase, the player might have 30-50 clips to choose from.

**Right Sidebar (Segment Detail View, slides in when a segment is selected):**
Shows the selected segment's clip and its customization options:
- **Confessional Overlay:** A dropdown to add a confessional clip from the stockpile. This recontextualizes the primary moment (e.g., show Jade crying, then overlay her earlier confessional saying "I'm totally fine").
- **Music Cue:** A dropdown of music categories (Romantic Swell, Sinister Sting, Comedic Bounce, etc.). Selecting a cue shows its effect on audience perception (+20 romance perception, +15 drama perception, etc.).
- **Chyron:** A text input field where the player can write a lower-third text overlay (e.g., "THREE DAYS EARLIER" or "BUT MARCUS DIDN'T KNOW…"). Chyrons are powerful — they can completely reframe a moment.

At the bottom of the sidebar: Remove Segment button.

**Bottom Bar (Persistent):**
- **Episode Quality Score:** Updates in real-time as you add/remove segments. Shows: Total Drama, Coherence, Narrative Rating (e.g., "Gripping television" or "Forgettable filler").
- **Warnings:** If legal risk average is too high, or coherence is too low, a warning icon appears with a tooltip explanation.
- **Preview Button:** Watch a compressed preview of the assembled episode (30-second skim, hitting key beats).
- **BROADCAST Button:** Big, green, in the bottom-right corner. When the player is satisfied, they click this to submit the episode.

**Interaction Feel:**
The edit bay is the most complex interface in the game, but it should never feel overwhelming. The segment-based structure (not frame-level editing) keeps it manageable. The real-time quality score gives constant feedback. The player is making a series of discrete choices: which moment goes in Segment 1? Does it need a confessional overlay? What music cue frames it? Every choice is intentional, not fiddly. When they click BROADCAST, they should feel like they've authored something — not just assembled something.

### 6.4 The Burn Book Interface

**Layout:**
Portrait orientation, simulating an open binder. Accessed via the left-side tab in the production suite, or as a quick reference during scene planning.

**Cast Roster View (Default):**
A list of all cast members, shown as dossier covers. Each entry shows:
- Headshot (polaroid-style, slightly faded)
- Name in typewriter font
- Archetype label (handwritten in the corner: "The Sweetheart," "The Villain," etc.)
- Current PI level (shown as a horizontal bar, color-coded)
- Confidence rating (how accurate the burn book thinks its intel is, shown as a percentage)

Click a cast member to open their full dossier.

**Individual Dossier View:**
A multi-page document. Navigation arrows at the bottom to flip between pages. The dossier feels like a physical document:
- Paper texture, slight yellowing
- Binder rings visible on the left edge
- Pages are numbered in the top-right corner
- Some pages have coffee stains, creased corners, post-it notes

**Page 1: Profile Overview**
- Large headshot (polaroid clipped to the page)
- Name, age, hometown, occupation (typed in typewriter font)
- Casting tape summary (a short paragraph describing their audition, what they said they wanted from the show)
- Archetype classification with a brief description
- Current status: Active or Eliminated (if eliminated, their elimination date and reason)

**Page 2: Psychological Profile**
- **Big Five Personality Scores:** Five horizontal bars showing Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism (0-100 scale)
- **Custom Axes:**
  - Televisuality (how good are they on camera?)
  - Self-Awareness (do they know they're being manipulated?)
  - Stress Tolerance (how much can they take before breaking?)
- **Core Desire:** One-sentence summary (e.g., "Needs to be seen as strong and independent")
- **Core Wound:** One-sentence summary (e.g., "Abandoned by mother at age 12; trust issues")
- **Predicted Breaking Point:** A stress threshold number (e.g., "PI below 35 likely triggers withdrawal")

Handwritten notes in the margins: the player's observations from previous episodes. These accumulate over time — by Episode 6, the margins are crowded with notes.

**Page 3: Relationship Map**
A visual web showing the cast member's relationships with others. Names are arranged in a circle around the subject. Lines connect them:
- **Solid green line:** Positive relationship, alliance
- **Dotted grey line:** Neutral, no strong bond
- **Solid red line:** Rivalry, conflict
- **Pink line with heart:** Romantic attraction

The thickness of the line indicates strength. Hovering over a line shows a tooltip with details (e.g., "Jade + Tanya: Strong alliance since Episode 2, bonded over Marcus confrontation").

**Page 4: Timeline & Key Events**
A chronological list of major events involving this cast member:
- "Episode 1, Day 3: Confrontation with Marcus — DV 78, aired in Segment 4"
- "Episode 2, Day 5: Confessional breakdown — PI dropped from 68 to 52, not aired"
- "Episode 3, Day 1: Surprise visit from ex — PI dropped to 45, partial meltdown"

Each event is a bullet point with a small timestamp, a brief description, and whether it was aired (if footage exists). This timeline helps the player track narrative arcs and understand how the cast member's journey has unfolded.

**Page 5+: Notes & Annotations**
Free-form notes the player can write. A text input field that looks like lined notebook paper. Handwritten-style font. The player can jot down theories, reminders, strategies ("Don't seat Jade near Marcus until PI recovers to 60+").

**Interaction Feel:**
The burn book is the most-consulted interface in the game. It needs to be fast to access, easy to scan, and dense with information without feeling cluttered. The physical document metaphor helps — players understand "flipping pages" more intuitively than nested menus. The accumulation of annotations over a season makes the burn book feel like *the player's tool*, not just a UI screen. By Episode 8, their burn book is a mess of notes, highlights, and corrections — and that mess tells a story.

### 6.5 The Ratings Report Interface

**Layout:**
Accessed after each broadcast. Can also be reviewed later from the right-side panel in the production suite.

**Document Style:**
The ratings report is presented as a physical document landing on the player's desk. A Nielsen printout (aged dot-matrix paper texture) stapled to a network memo (typed on letterhead with handwritten executive notes in the margins).

**Page 1: The Nielsen Number**
Large, bold, center of the page. The rating (e.g., **2.7**) in gold (#f5c518). Below it, in smaller text: audience share percentage and total viewership in millions.

A handwritten note from the network exec in the margin: "Not bad" or "We need more" or "Advertisers are nervous" — contextualizes the raw number.

**Page 2: Audience Segment Breakdown**
Five horizontal bars, one for each audience segment:
- Drama Addicts
- Romantics
- Justice Seekers
- Strategists
- Chaos Agents

Each bar shows:
- Satisfaction percentage (0-100%)
- Change from last episode (e.g., "+5%" in green or "-8%" in red)
- A brief note explaining why (e.g., "Loved the Marcus/Jade confrontation" or "Wanted more romance")

Segments below 30% satisfaction for 3+ consecutive episodes are flagged with a red "EXODUS RISK" label.

**Page 3: Advertiser & Network Metrics**
- **Advertiser Confidence Index (ACI):** A number 0-100, shown with a gold coin icon. Higher = more ad revenue.
- **Brand Safety Score:** Shows legal risk average of aired moments. If this is too high, a yellow warning appears: "Advertisers concerned about content."
- **Network Satisfaction Score (NSS):** A number 0-100, shown with a network logo. Below 40 = intervention risk. Above 75 = creative freedom bonus.

Each metric has a small arrow indicating trend (up, down, stable).

**Page 4: Social Media Sentiment Feed**
A scrolling list of simulated viewer reactions (text posts, not images). These are procedurally generated based on the episode content:
- "OMG Jade finally stood up to Marcus!! #Burnbook"
- "This show is so fake, they're clearly manipulating them"
- "I can't watch this anymore, they're destroying these people"
- "BEST EPISODE YET. More drama please."

The feed is a mix of positive, negative, and neutral reactions. The player can scroll through it to get a sense of audience mood — it's not just data, it's human responses (simulated).

**Page 5: Network Notes (If Any)**
If the network has specific feedback or demands, it appears as a typed memo:
- "We need a stronger love story by Episode 6."
- "Legal is reviewing the Jade footage from Episode 3. Be careful."
- "Ratings are slipping. Consider a mid-season twist."

Handwritten exec signatures at the bottom. These notes are actionable — the player needs to adjust strategy based on network demands.

**Interaction Feel:**
The ratings report is a moment of judgment. The player has just spent 30+ minutes assembling an episode, and now they see the result. The report should feel weighty — not just a pop-up with a number, but a document they read and absorb. The handwritten notes add personality (the network exec is a character, even if unseen). The social media feed adds humanity (real people watched this and had real reactions). The breakdown into metrics (Nielsen, segments, ACI, NSS) allows the player to diagnose exactly what worked and what didn't.

## 7. ASSET PIPELINE & TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### 7.1 Resolution & Display Targets

**Primary Target: 1920x1080 (16:9), PC Desktop**
All UI assets are designed at 1080p. 60fps target. The game should run on mid-range hardware (GTX 1060 / RX 580 equivalent or better).

**Secondary Target: 1280x800 (16:10), Steam Deck**
UI scales down proportionally. Text sizes are large enough at base 1080p to remain readable at 800p. The production suite layout compresses slightly (monitor bank shrinks, timeline remains full-width). All interactions remain mouse/trackpad-friendly (no touch-specific redesigns needed).

**Tertiary Target: 2560x1440 and 4K (16:9), High-End Displays**
UI scales up using vector assets (see below). No pixelation. Text remains sharp. Bitmap textures (paper, film grain) are provided at 2x resolution to support 4K without quality loss.

### 7.2 Asset Formats & Organization

**Vector UI (SVG or vector-based framework):**
All UI shapes (buttons, panels, borders, icons) are vector-based. Scales cleanly to any resolution. Exported at runtime to match display resolution.

**Bitmap Textures (PNG, 8-bit or 24-bit):**
Used for:
- Paper textures (burn book pages, Nielsen reports)
- Film grain overlays (for footage monitors)
- Photographic elements (cast member headshots, location schematics)
- Wear & tear details (coffee stains, creased paper, dust)

Provided in 2x resolution (e.g., a 512x512 texture for a 256x256 UI element) to support 4K displays and future-proofing.

**Footage / Video Clips (Procedural or Pre-rendered):**
Cast member footage (scenes, confessionals) can be:
- **Procedural (preferred):** AI-generated or emergent from simulation. Characters are represented as 2D animated portraits or simple 3D models with limited animation. This allows infinite variation and no storage bloat.
- **Pre-rendered (fallback):** If procedural isn't feasible, pre-rendered clips with branching paths. Higher fidelity but much larger asset footprint.

Footage is displayed at 720p or lower (to simulate SD-era television production) even on 1080p+ displays. The low resolution is intentional — part of the aesthetic.

**Audio Assets:**
- **Ambient sound loops:** Production office hum, fluorescent lights, distant phones (OGG Vorbis, looped)
- **UI sounds:** Button clicks, paper rustles, tape deck whirs, monitor power-on (WAV, short, <0.5s)
- **Music cues:** 20-30 short musical stingers for the edit bay (OGG Vorbis, 10-30s each, loopable)
- **Voiceover (optional):** If cast members have voiced dialogue, use compressed voice files (OGG Vorbis, mono, 22kHz sample rate is sufficient for television-quality dialogue)

### 7.3 Production Workflow

**UI Mockups → Vector Implementation → In-Engine Integration**

1. **Mockup Phase:**
   Art director (PIXEL) creates high-fidelity mockups in Figma or Adobe XD. These are static screens showing every interface state: default, hover, active, disabled, error. Color values are specified in hex. Typography is locked in. Spacing is measured.

2. **Asset Export:**
   UI panels, icons, buttons are exported as SVG (vector). Textures and photos are exported as PNG (2x resolution). Fonts are licensed and included in the project (or web-safe fallbacks are specified).

3. **In-Engine Implementation:**
   UI engineers build the interface in-engine (Unity, Unreal, Godot, or custom framework). Vector assets are rendered at runtime resolution. Textures are applied as overlays. Typography is implemented using the specified font stack.

4. **Animation Pass:**
   Motion designer implements the animations specified in Section 5. Timing, easing, and triggers are tested. Placeholder transitions are replaced with polished animations.

5. **Playtest & Iterate:**
   Put the interface in front of players. Identify pain points: is text readable? Are buttons too small? Is the burn book navigation intuitive? Iterate based on feedback, referring back to the readability checklist (Section 8).

Snake_case for all files. Descriptive names. Organized by type and context.

### 7.5 Performance Budget

**UI Rendering:**
Target: 60fps at 1080p on mid-range hardware. The UI is mostly 2D vector and bitmap overlays — not GPU-intensive. Budget: <5ms per frame for UI rendering (leaves 11ms for game logic and other rendering).

**Footage Playback:**
If using video clips, budget: 4-6 simultaneous video streams at 720p (for the multi-camera monitor bank during scenes). Use hardware video decoding where available. If frame rate dips below 30fps during playback, reduce footage resolution or limit simultaneous streams.

**Memory Footprint:**
Target: <2GB RAM for all UI and audio assets at runtime. Cast member data (burn book profiles, relationship maps, event histories) should be stored efficiently — JSON or binary serialization, not bloated save files.

---

## 8. READABILITY CHECKLIST

This is the minimum bar. If any of these checks fail, the interface needs revision.

### 8.1 The Squint Test
**Test:** Blur your eyes and look at the screen. Can you still identify the focal point? Can you tell which UI element is active?
**Pass Condition:** Active elements (glowing monitors, selected timeline segments, open burn book) are immediately visible even when squinting. Inactive elements recede into the background.
**Common Failure:** Too many bright elements competing for attention. Fix: Dim inactive elements, increase contrast on active elements.

### 8.2 The Thumbnail Test
**Test:** Scale the screen down to 256x144 (YouTube thumbnail size). Can you still tell what's happening?
**Pass Condition:** The production suite is recognizable (dark space with glowing monitors). The edit bay timeline is visible as a horizontal strip. The burn book is recognizable as a document.
**Common Failure:** Too much fine detail. Fix: Simplify, increase key visual elements (monitor glows, red recording lights, gold ratings numbers).

### 8.3 The Colorblind Test
**Test:** Apply deuteranopia (red-green colorblind) and protanopia filters. Is critical information still legible?
**Pass Condition:** Color is never the only indicator of state. Green/red status is also communicated via icon shape or text label. Stress meters use position (full/empty) not just color. Drama value numbers are always accompanied by text, not just color-coded bars.
**Tools:** Use Photoshop or browser plugins (Colorblinding, etc.) to simulate colorblind vision.
**Common Failure:** Stress meters that are only color-coded. Fix: Add text labels ("Stable," "Stressed," "Breaking") or icon indicators.

### 8.4 The Five-Second Test
**Test:** Show a screenshot to a new viewer for five seconds, then hide it. Ask: "What was the most important element on screen?"
**Pass Condition:** The viewer can correctly identify the focal point (the active monitor, the ratings number, the cast member's face in the burn book).
**Common Failure:** Focal point is not clear — too many competing elements. Fix: Hierarchy. Use size, color, contrast, and negative space to guide the eye.

### 8.5 The Night Mode Test
**Test:** View the interface in a dark room with no ambient light. Does it cause eye strain?
**Pass Condition:** The dark blue/black background is dominant. Bright whites are used sparingly (only for key text). No pure white backgrounds (use off-white #e8e8e8 instead).
**Common Failure:** Too many bright elements, causing glare in a dark room. Fix: Reduce brightness of secondary elements, increase use of dark backgrounds.

### 8.6 The Font Size Test
**Test:** View the interface from 3 feet away (typical monitor distance). Can you read body text without leaning in?
**Pass Condition:** 14px body text at 1080p is readable from 3 feet. Smaller text (12px, 10px) is only used for non-critical metadata.
**Common Failure:** Important information in 10px font. Fix: Increase to 12px minimum, or redesign the element to require less text.

### 8.7 The Information Density Test
**Test:** Count the number of distinct pieces of information on the production suite home screen. Is it overwhelming?
**Pass Condition:** No more than 10-12 distinct UI elements visible simultaneously. Cast roster, monitor bank, timeline preview, budget display, alert feed — each is a distinct element. More than 12 and the screen feels cluttered.
**Common Failure:** Too many panels open at once. Fix: Collapsible panels, tabbed interfaces, progressive disclosure.

### 8.8 The Interaction Latency Test
**Test:** Click a button. Does the feedback feel instant?
**Pass Condition:** Visual feedback (button press animation, hover state) appears within 100ms. The action itself (opening a panel, starting a scene) can take longer, but the player must see immediate acknowledgment that their input was received.
**Common Failure:** No hover state or delayed feedback. The player clicks again because they think the first click didn't register. Fix: Instant hover/active states on all interactive elements.

---

## 9. STYLE RULES (DO'S AND DON'TS)

### 9.1 DO: Use Constraints as Design Tools

**DO** embrace the 2005 production suite aesthetic. The boxy CRT monitors, the grey Avid panels, the dot-matrix printouts — these constraints define the visual identity. Trying to "modernize" the interface breaks the fiction.

**DO** use the 16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratios as compositional guides. Monitors are rectangles. Footage lives in rectangular frames. The burn book is portrait (8.5x11). These shapes define the visual grammar.

**DO** limit the color palette. 90% of the screen should be dark blues, greys, and blacks. The remaining 10% is where you deploy red, gold, coral, cyan, green — and every instance must mean something.

**DO** use negative space aggressively. The darkness around the monitors isn't emptiness — it's the production suite, the void from which the player watches. Empty space creates focus.

**DO** make the UI feel tactile. Pages turn, clips snap, monitors flicker on. The player is operating equipment and handling documents, not clicking abstract buttons.

### 9.2 DON'T: Prioritize Beauty Over Clarity

**DON'T** add decorative flourishes. No lens flares, no particle effects, no animated backgrounds. Every pixel must serve a function.

**DON'T** use glossy, skeuomorphic design. No shiny buttons, no fake 3D depth effects, no gradients for style. The interface is flat and utilitarian. The only "depth" comes from layered panels (burn book slides over the monitor bank) and subtle glows on active elements.

**DON'T** make the footage look cinematic. It should look like 2005-era reality TV — slightly oversaturated, slightly soft, with visible compression artifacts. If the footage looks like a Hollywood film, the aesthetic is wrong.

**DON'T** hide information behind mystery. The player needs to know what everything does. Tooltips should be instant and clear. Cryptic icons or unlabeled buttons break the professional tool aesthetic.

**DON'T** animate for spectacle. Animations are functional: they communicate state change, direct attention, or provide feedback. If an animation is just "cool," cut it.

### 9.3 DO: Build Hierarchy Through Scale and Contrast

**DO** use size to indicate importance. The Nielsen rating on the report is 48px and gold — it's the most important number. Cast names in the burn book are 32px — important but secondary. UI labels are 12px — metadata.

**DO** use contrast to direct the eye. White text on dark blue (high contrast) is for critical info. Grey text on dark blue (medium contrast) is for secondary info. The player's eye naturally goes to the highest-contrast elements first.

**DO** use position to indicate priority. Top-left = primary navigation. Center = focal content. Bottom = persistent toolbars. Top-right = alerts and secondary info. This follows western reading conventions (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).

**DO** use color sparingly for emphasis. A single red alert in a sea of grey immediately draws the eye. If everything is red, nothing is.

### 9.4 DON'T: Break the Mediation Metaphor

**DON'T** let the player see the cast members directly. They always appear on monitors, in footage, through cameras. The player never inhabits the same space as the cast. The mediation is the point.

**DON'T** use first-person or third-person camera views. The player is not a character in the space. They are the watcher, the editor, the producer. They exist behind the glass, behind the screens.

**DON'T** let the cast members break the fourth wall unintentionally. When they look at the camera in confessionals, they're looking at the production camera, not at the player. The player is watching the footage later, in the edit bay. The distance is essential.

**DON'T** make the production suite feel lived-in or cozy. It's a workspace. Fluorescent lights, office chairs, stained carpet, cable-managed equipment. It's not a home. It's a machine for processing people into content.

### 9.5 DO: Let the Game Accumulate Visual History

**DO** let the burn book pages accumulate wear. Coffee stains, creased corners, marginal notes — these build up over a season. By Episode 8, the burn book should look *used*.

**DO** let the production desk accumulate clutter. Coffee cups, post-it notes, call sheets. Clear it at the start of each season, but let it build during the season. The clutter is a visual representation of workload and time passing.

**DO** let the footage stockpile grow. By the edit bay phase of Episode 6, the player might have 50+ clips. The sheer volume is part of the experience — sorting through footage, finding the right moment. The abundance is intentional.

**DO** let former cast members remain in the burn book, greyed out. They're gone, but their pages remain. A visual reminder of the people who passed through the show. The haunting is systemic.

### 9.6 DON'T: Let Complexity Become Chaos

**DON'T** show all information at once. Use progressive disclosure: basic stats visible, advanced stats on hover or click. The burn book can be deep without being overwhelming on first glance.

**DON'T** let the monitor bank become a mess. During scenes, show 4-6 camera feeds in a clean grid. Don't let the player tile and resize monitors freely — that creates visual chaos. The layout is fixed, professional.

**DON'T** let the editing timeline become cluttered. If a segment has a confessional overlay, music cue, and chyron, represent those with small icons, not detailed thumbnails. The timeline should be scannable at a glance.

**DON'T** let alerts pile up. Old alerts auto-dismiss after a few seconds. Only critical alerts persist. The alert feed should never have more than 3-4 items visible — beyond that, it's noise.

---

## 10. TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS SUMMARY

### 10.1 Rendering Constraints

**Frame Rate:** 60fps minimum at 1920x1080 on target hardware (GTX 1060 / RX 580 equivalent).
**UI Frame Budget:** <5ms per frame for UI rendering.
**Video Playback:** 4-6 simultaneous 720p streams during multi-camera scenes. Hardware decoding preferred.

### 10.2 Asset Size Constraints

**Total UI Asset Footprint:** <500MB (all UI graphics, textures, icons, fonts).
**Audio Asset Footprint:** <200MB (all UI sounds, ambient loops, music cues).
**Per-Cast Member Asset Budget:** <5MB (headshot, voice files if applicable, procedural animation data). For a 16-person cast, that's <80MB total.
**Footage Storage:** If using pre-rendered video, budget 50-100MB per episode of raw footage. For an 8-episode season, that's 400-800MB. Procedural footage generation eliminates this cost but requires more runtime CPU/GPU.

### 10.3 Performance Targets

**Load Times:**
- Production suite (home screen): <2 seconds cold load, <0.5 seconds returning from scene
- Burn book panel: <0.3 seconds to slide in
- Edit bay interface: <1 second to load footage stockpile
- Ratings report: <0.5 seconds to generate and display

**Memory Footprint:**
- Total game RAM usage: <4GB on recommended spec
- UI and audio assets: <2GB resident in RAM
- Cast simulation data: <100MB (for a 16-person cast with full relationship maps and event histories)

### 10.4 Resolution & Scaling

**Minimum Supported Resolution:** 1280x720 (16:9). Below this, text becomes unreadable and UI elements are too cramped.
**Recommended Resolution:** 1920x1080 (16:9). The game is designed at this resolution.
**Maximum Tested Resolution:** 3840x2160 (4K, 16:9). All vector UI and 2x bitmap textures scale cleanly.

**UI Scaling:**
The game should offer a UI scale slider in settings: 80% / 90% / 100% / 110% / 120%. Allows players on high-DPI displays to increase text size, or players who want more screen space to shrink UI.

### 10.5 Accessibility Constraints

**Colorblind Support:** All critical information must be conveyed through shape, text, or position in addition to color. Stress meters have text labels. Drama value is always a number, not just a color-coded bar.

**Font Size Minimum:** 12px for any text that communicates critical information. 10px absolute minimum for metadata.

**Contrast Ratio Minimum:** 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text (18px+). This ensures readability for players with low vision.

**Subtitles (if cast members speak):** All dialogue must have subtitles. Subtitle text is white with a black drop shadow, 16px minimum, positioned in the lower third of the footage frame.

---

## 11. PROTOTYPE MOCKUPS (REFERENCE DESCRIPTIONS)

Since this is a text document, I'll describe what the key mockups should look like. The art director (you, PIXEL) would create these in Figma/XD/Photoshop during pre-production.

### 11.1 Mockup 1: Production Suite (Home Screen)

**Description:**
A dark room. The background is #1a1a2e (editing suite midnight) with a subtle texture (film grain at 5% opacity). In the center-top, four monitors arranged in a 2x2 grid. Each monitor has a thick bezel (#0f3460, monitor blue) and shows frozen footage: a dinner table scene (wide shot), a close-up of a woman's face mid-argument, an empty confessional booth, and a poolside conversation. The top-left monitor has a subtle white glow (active). In the bottom-right corner of each monitor, a small timecode in white text.

Below the monitors, a horizontal timeline preview: 6 rectangular slots, 3 filled with thumbnail clips, 3 empty (shown as dashed outlines). The filled slots show tiny thumbnails of moments. Each has a small DV number in the corner (e.g., "DV 68").

On the left edge, a vertical tab labeled "BURN BOOK" in all-caps, white text. It's slightly glowing, indicating it's clickable.

On the right edge, a vertical tab labeled "REPORTS".

At the bottom, a horizontal bar (the production desk): left side shows "EPISODE 4 / 8 | BUDGET: $48,000", center shows "NEXT SCENE IN 00:02:30", right side has three small buttons: "PLAN SCENE" (green), "CAST MGMT", "FORMAT".

In the top-right corner, a small floating panel showing two alerts:
- "Jade Morrison: STRESS HIGH (PI: 52)" in coral text
- "Network Note Received" in gold text

The entire composition feels like you're sitting at a desk in a dark room, surrounded by glowing screens. The negative space (the darkness) is significant — it's not empty, it's the production suite's atmosphere.

### 11.2 Mockup 2: The Burn Book (Individual Dossier)

**Description:**
The burn book panel slides in from the left, overlaying 30% of the screen. The background is an aged paper texture (#f5f3ed, slightly yellowed), with subtle binder ring holes visible on the left edge.

**Header:**
Top of the page shows a polaroid-style photo of Jade Morrison (headshot, slightly faded, clipped to the page with a subtle shadow). Next to it, her name in large typewriter font (Courier Prime, 32px): "JADE MORRISON". Below her name, in smaller handwritten font: "The Sweetheart" (archetype label).

**Body (Page 1):**
A block of typewriter text:
> Age: 27 | Hometown: Charlotte, NC | Occupation: Elementary School Teacher
> Casting Tape Summary: Jade presented as warm, bubbly, eager to make connections. Cited a difficult breakup as motivation to "put herself out there." Mentioned a strained relationship with her mother. Seemed genuine, perhaps too genuine — potential for emotional volatility under stress.

Below that, a section labeled "CURRENT STATUS":
> Active — Episode 4, Day 6
> Psychological Integrity: 52 (FRAGILE) — shown as a horizontal bar, mostly empty, coral color
> Confidence Rating: 68% — shown with a small stamp icon

In the margins, handwritten notes in blue pen:
- "Watch her with Marcus — unresolved tension" (circled)
- "Tanya is her only ally — don't separate them!" (underlined)
- "Mother wound is DEEP — use carefully" (starred)

At the bottom-right, small arrow icons labeled "NEXT PAGE >".

The page looks lived-in: a coffee ring stain in the top-right corner, a yellow highlighter streak over "emotional volatility," a post-it note stuck to the edge (blank, just a visual detail).

### 11.3 Mockup 3: The Edit Bay Interface

**Description:**
Full-screen. The background is #16213e (timeline dark).

**Top section (timeline):**
A horizontal strip spanning the width. 6 vertical segment slots, each labeled at the top: "SEG 1", "SEG 2", etc. Segments 1-4 are filled with clips (small thumbnails showing frozen frames). Segment 1's thumbnail shows Jade crying. In the corner of the thumbnail: "DV 78" in gold, and small icons indicating a music cue (musical note icon) and a confessional overlay (speech bubble icon). Segments 5-6 are empty (dashed outline).

**Middle section (footage stockpile):**
Below the timeline, a scrollable horizontal row of 20+ thumbnail clips. Each thumbnail is a small square (80px x 80px) showing a frozen frame from footage. Hovering over one reveals a tooltip:
> Scene 3: Dinner Table
> DV: 68 | Authenticity: 82 | Legal Risk: 35
> Cast: Jade, Marcus
> Duration: 00:01:45

Some clips have a small red corner flag (high legal risk). Some have a gold star (high drama value).

**Right sidebar (segment detail):**
Slides in when Segment 1 is clicked. Shows a larger thumbnail of the Jade crying clip. Below it:
- **CONFESSIONAL OVERLAY:** A dropdown showing "Jade — 'I'm totally fine' (Ep 3, Day 2)" (selected)
- **MUSIC CUE:** A dropdown showing "Melancholy Piano" (selected), with a small note: "+25 empathy, +10 authenticity"
- **CHYRON:** A text input field with "BUT SHE WASN'T FINE." typed in
- A red "REMOVE SEGMENT" button at the bottom

**Bottom bar (persistent):**
Left side: **EPISODE QUALITY: "Gripping Television"** in white text, with a small checkmark icon.
Center: **Total Drama: 420 | Coherence: 78** in smaller text.
Right side: A large green button labeled "BROADCAST EPISODE".

The interface feels dense but organized. Every element has a clear purpose. The player is making editorial choices, not fiddling with technical sliders.

### 11.4 Mockup 4: The Ratings Report

**Description:**
A simulated document filling the screen. It's presented as a printout on a desk (the production desk background is visible around the edges — dark wood texture, a coffee cup, a pen).

**Top of the page:**
A dot-matrix printed header: "NIELSEN MEDIA RESEARCH — WEEKLY RATINGS REPORT"

**Center of the page:**
The rating number in huge, bold, gold text: **2.7**
Below it, smaller: "8.2M Viewers | 14% Share"

In the margin, a handwritten note in red pen: "Good work. Keep it up." with an executive's signature scrawl.

**Below the rating:**
Five horizontal bars showing audience segment satisfaction:
- **Drama Addicts:** 88% (+6% from last week) — green up arrow
- **Romantics:** 42% (-5% from last week) — red down arrow
- **Justice Seekers:** 65% (stable) — grey neutral icon
- **Strategists:** 71% (+3%) — green up arrow
- **Chaos Agents:** 95% (+12%) — green up arrow

Next to "Romantics," a small note: "They want a love story. Give them one."

**Bottom section:**
- **Advertiser Confidence Index: 72** (gold coin icon)
- **Network Satisfaction Score: 68** (network logo icon)
- A small yellow warning icon next to Brand Safety Score: "Legal flagged one moment in Segment 4 — review before next episode."

At the very bottom, a typed network memo:
> "Solid episode. Ratings are climbing. However, we're concerned about cast sustainability — Jade's stress levels are being monitored. Legal will be in touch."

The document feels official, weighty, and detailed. The handwritten notes add personality. The player reads this and knows exactly what to do next: appease the Romantics, be careful with Jade, keep riding the Drama Addicts' satisfaction.

## 12. REFERENCE LIST (GAMES, FILMS, ART)

### 12.1 Games (Mechanical & Aesthetic References)

**Papers, Please (2013)**
The document inspector interface. The moral weight of bureaucratic work. The way consequences compound over time. The tactile feeling of stamping dossiers and cross-referencing information.

**Her Story (2015)**
The CRT monitor aesthetic. The database search interface. The player assembling narrative from fragmented video clips. The sense of being a detective piecing together truth from footage.

**The Movies (2005)** — Aesthetic only, NOT mechanical
The behind-the-scenes production environment. The timeline-based movie editing. The sense of being a mogul building an entertainment empire. (BURNBOOK diverges mechanically — less tycoon, more narrative control — but the production suite setting is relevant.)

**Hypnospace Outlaw (2019)**
The period-authentic interface (1999 internet). The sense of inhabiting a specific technological moment. The way nostalgia is used not for comfort but for commentary. The tactile, detailed UI.

**RimWorld (2018)**
The AI-driven simulation where characters have genuine psychological states, memory, and breaking points. The way the player is complicit in suffering because the game systems reward exploitation. The long-tail consequences of player decisions.

**Beholder (2016)**
The surveillance apartment building. The way the player watches people through cameras and makes decisions about their lives. The moral compromise baked into the core loop.

**Orwell (2016)**
The surveillance state simulation. The act of collecting intel on individuals and assembling dossiers. The way information gathering is gamified and made uncomfortable. The interface-as-gameplay.

### 12.2 Films (Visual & Tonal References)

**Nightcrawler (2014, dir. Dan Gilroy)**
The cold, detached relationship between the cameraman and his subjects. The surveillance footage aesthetic. The way the protagonist watches violence through a screen and sees opportunity, not humanity. The nighttime LA cinematography (dark blues, neon accents, the glow of screens in a car).

**The Conversation (1974, dir. Francis Ford Coppola)**
The surveillance equipment. The reel-to-reel tape decks, headphones, the physicality of recording technology. The obsessive rewatching of footage, trying to parse meaning. The moral weight of listening.

**Zodiac (2007, dir. David Fincher)**
The obsessive documentation. The cork boards covered in notes and photos. The fluorescent-lit offices and basements where the investigation happens. The sense of being buried in information, searching for patterns. The way Fincher shoots institutional spaces (newsrooms, police stations) — they're cold, grey, utilitarian.

**Michael Clayton (2007, dir. Tony Gilroy)**
The corporate law office aesthetic. The grey suits, the grey offices, the grey morality. The sense of being a fixer operating in the shadows of a larger machine. The way power is wielded through documents and decisions, not violence.

**Margin Call (2011, dir. J.C. Chandor)**
The nighttime office setting. The fluorescent lights, the conference rooms, the way a crisis unfolds in a corporate space. The way moral decisions are made in sterile environments by people in suits. The aesthetic of institutional evil.

**All the President's Men (1976, dir. Alan J. Pakula)**
The newsroom. The clacking typewriters, the ringing phones, the stacks of documents. The way investigation is depicted as work — unglamorous, painstaking, accumulative. The 1970s institutional aesthetic (wood paneling, beige walls, harsh overhead lighting).

**UnReal (2015-2018, TV show — key reference)**
The behind-the-scenes of reality TV production. The control room with multiple monitors. The producers manipulating cast members in real-time. The ethical compromises. The way the show depicts reality TV as a machine that processes human vulnerability into content. This is the most direct aesthetic and tonal reference for BURNBOOK.

### 12.3 Art & Photography (Compositional References)

**Edward Hopper (particularly "Nighthawks," "Office at Night")**
The isolated figure in an institutional space. The geometry of alienation: harsh angles, strong shadows, the person dwarfed by their environment. The sense of being watched or watching. The cold artificial light.

**Andreas Gursky (photography, particularly "99 Cent II," "Rhein II")**
The overwhelming grid. The sense of systems too large to comprehend but perfectly organized. The high vantage point that flattens perspective and turns humans into patterns. The burn book's cast management screen should evoke this.

**Rineke Dijkstra (photography, particularly her portrait series)**
The uncomfortable direct gaze. The subject looking into the camera, slightly off-center, against a neutral background. The confessional booth framing in BURNBOOK should reference this: the cast member isolated, vulnerable, looking directly at the lens.

**Thomas Demand (photography/sculpture, particularly "Control Room," "Vault")**
The constructed institutional spaces. The way Demand builds life-size models of office spaces, interrogation rooms, archives — then photographs them. The uncanny smoothness, the absence of humans, the sense that these spaces exist to process things. The production suite in BURNBOOK should evoke this: a space built for work, not living.

**William Eggleston (photography, particularly his use of fluorescent lighting)**
The sickly green-yellow glow of fluorescent office lights. The way artificial light flattens color and creates a queasy, institutional atmosphere. The production suite's lighting should reference this — not warmly lit, but coldly functional.

### 12.4 Television & Media (Format & Context References)

**The Real World (MTV, 1992-present)**
The confessional booth. The multi-camera setup in a shared living space. The "true story" tagline and the pretense of unscripted reality.

**Survivor (CBS, 2000-present)**
The Tribal Council setting. The way elimination is a spectacle. The confessional interviews intercut with footage to create narrative.

**The Bachelor / The Bachelorette (ABC, 2002-present)**
The manufactured romance. The "rose ceremony" as ritual. The way dates are staged for maximum drama. The confessional interviews where contestants process their emotions.

**Big Brother (CBS, 2000-present)**
The surveillance aesthetic. The 24/7 camera coverage. The Diary Room confessionals. The way the show creates a panopticon where cast members are always watched.

**America's Next Top Model (UPN/The CW, 2003-2015)**
Tyra Banks' confessional coaching. The elimination panel. The way the show frames itself as opportunity while subjecting contestants to humiliation for entertainment.

**Behind the Music (VH1, 1997-2014)**
The documentary confessional format. The way the show uses archival footage intercut with present-day interviews to construct a narrative of rise, fall, and (sometimes) redemption.

**The Larry Sanders Show (HBO, 1992-1998)**
The behind-the-scenes of a talk show. The control room, the green room, the tension between on-camera performance and off-camera reality. The fluorescent-lit backstage spaces.

## 14. CLOSING NOTES FROM PIXEL

I've been the art director on games that looked beautiful and failed. I've been the art director on games that looked ugly and succeeded. The difference wasn't the beauty — it was the **readability**. A game about surveillance and mediation MUST communicate its systems clearly, or the player is just clicking around in a dark room, guessing.

BURNBOOK's visual identity is intentionally unglamorous because the work it depicts is unglamorous. Reality TV production is not a glamorous job. It's a job performed in windowless rooms by people making moral compromises for ratings. If the game looks too slick, too polished, too "designed," it betrays the fiction. The production suite should look like a place where work happens, not a place where art happens.

The 2005 aesthetic isn't nostalgia — it's specificity. The technological constraints of that era (SD cameras, tape-based editing, CRT monitors) are what made reality TV production feel the way it felt. The low resolution meant you couldn't see every detail — you had to editorialize, to construct. The manual editing process meant you felt the cut. The mediated view was the only view. As technology improved, reality TV got slicker and less interesting. BURNBOOK lives in the moment before the slickness, when the machinery was still visible.

The visual identity has one job: **make the player feel the power and the distance**. Power because they control everything — the cameras, the edit, the narrative. Distance because they never touch the cast, never breathe the same air, never see them except through screens. If a player finishes an episode and feels like they've just spent 30 minutes in a dark room making decisions that will affect real people, the art direction has succeeded. If they feel like they've been playing a video game, it's failed.

Every pixel earns its place. Every color means something. Every UI element has a function. There's no decoration. There's no beauty for beauty's sake. There's only the work, and the screens, and the darkness around them.

Does this read at a glance? Yes.
Does it scale to hour 100? Yes.
Does it promise power and complicity? Yes.

Let's build this.

— PIXEL
